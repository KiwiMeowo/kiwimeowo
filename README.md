# WHAT IS GOING ON HERE
<p>Breakfast</p>
<h2>Hello, welcome to Kiwi's Github</h2>
<p>This is the place where I put my code for my site <a href="https://kiwimeowo.neocities.org" target="_blank">kiwimeowo.neocities.org</a>.</p>
<p>I made this public because I feel like this can be some sort of reference if anyone else wanted to try using Github to deploy to Neocities, though it does mean you can just find all my secret pages instead of finding random links hidden somewhere, but why would you not want to find them the authentic way?</p>
