The closest one is the time when my classmate stole my drawing notebook and looked at it (and took out one of my OC notes), but that isn't the type I consider the worst.</p><p>Perhaps it's how silent I am about myself, not even my family knows a lot about what I like. While it is nice that nobody gets to make fun of me, it still gets lonely at times, it feels like I am the only one in the world who likes random niche interests like drawing anime-ish characters and watching silly stories.</p><p>On April, I made Cosmos plush, while it doesn't look perfect, I was quite proud of it. As I often see people take pictures of their fav characters in nui plush form, I decided to imitate them and take pics of Cosmos plush in random scenarios, like holding a pack of lemon tea.</p><p>I send these photos to my Discord server, but more often times I send them to Instagram, why is that? Well, when I just started posting Cosmos plush to my Instagram stories, a close friend of mine responded to them, just silly messages like "1.5 lemon tea big". But the fact he actually responded actually encouraged me to post more of Cosmos plush (and Lavender plush too), he doesn't know about Cosmos' story, but he now recognises her appearance.</p><p>There isn't a lot of people I know IRL who knows about my OCs, the only other person who knows them by name is my sister. This interaction actually means a lot to me, like I don't think there is a lot of people who understands my interests, or they just respond to me with "oh.. oh yeah" while trying to be non-judgemental. It feels very great that I can just send him a random pic of Cosmos plush every now and then.</p><p>Man I can't wait for exam to be done.</p><p class="date">( 21 Dec 2024 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
