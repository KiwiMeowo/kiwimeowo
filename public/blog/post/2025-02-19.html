While it is a very good game for passing time in the train, it also made me more upset than I want to admit. And after being scolded by a customer for not adding pesto sauce to their pizza (even though they never mentioned shit about pesto), I got pissed and decided to code this game through javascript.</p><p>Although I never coded a game before, I have a feeling that coding this is possible, and I have some idea how to implement some of the mechanic (like adding toppings and cooking the pizza). And if I managed to recreate the game, it might bring me so much improvement to my boring train waitings.</p><ol><li>I can make the customers less mad at me if I get their order wrong</li><li>Play in portrait instead of landscape (Figuring out if it's feasible rn)</li><li>Custom toppings</li><li>Custom orders</li><li>My OC cameos</li><li>I can feed them raw dough</li></ol><p>With my newbie-ish Javascript skills, I managed to add pizza dough to the counter, add toppings to the dough, and even cook it. However, I am having a lot of trouble for the pizza grading system, because of the half-and-half pizzas and multi-pizza orders. If I have to make a half pepperoni and half onion pizza, it isn't determined if the pep should be on the left or right. It is easier gameplay-wise, but it's difficult to implement for me, because I have to compare each half of the pizza to each half of the desired order. And some orders will require three different types of pizza, which makes the task way difficult.</p><p>So far, the progress looks like below, simple enough to understand what I should do. I really wish I can get through the difficult parts, so that I can start adding orders and play the game without the worry of being scolded again.</p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3n2eqm3t0pai6vasc5ri3/BadPizzaWorstPizza_20250219.jpg?rlkey=hcdspkb24yf7h34eqfzsanqy2&st=4io97dvm&raw=1"><p>I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post this recreation to my site, I'm not to familiar with copyright and stuff, I think coding this for personal practiceing isn't illegal. But whatever's the case, this blog just shows how far I'll go just to reduce the amount of times I get emotional damage. Being sensitive is both a curse and a blessing, I guess.</p></div><p class="date">( 19 Feb 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../e.js"></script><script src="../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
