This year, I&#39;m going to do the same.">星見る頃を過ぎても - Best Album Version</a></p><p>Mood: Deep thought...</p><p>Random thought: Met my primary school close friend yesterday, my brain is still processing the stuff</p></div><div class="text"><p>One year, 12 months, 365 days (or 366 days depending if it's a leap year), it feels like such a long time. And yet we have gone through yet another years, despite all the hardships. My brain does not store memory well anymore, unless if it is VERY, VERY important, I tend to forget stuff, even if it's the stuff that I like quite much. I want to do a little review for this year, a record of stuff that happened in this site and my life.</p><hr><h2>Blogs</h2><p>This year I have been quite talkative, here's the number of blogs I've made in each quarter of 2024:</p><ul><li>Jan-Mar: 24</li><li>Apr-Jun: 21</li><li>Jul-Sep: 23</li><li>Oct-Dec: 47 + 1 = 48</li></ul><p>In total, I have made<u> 116 </u>blogs in total, I have no idea how the blogs in the last quarter doubled in numbers, but I couldn't stop yapping. Moreover, I also counted the approximate amount of words I have said in total, using this code:</p><pre>
var word = document.getElementsByClassName("content");
var i=0;
for (x=0;x &lt; word.length;x++){
i += parseInt(word[x].innerText.split(" ").length);
}
console.log(i)
</pre><p>There's a bit of modifications in the code for old blogs, but the logic is the same. Also, the numbers might not be completely accurate, as it also counts random punctuations sometimes. Anyways, here's the statistics:</p><ul><li>Jan-Mar: 16010 (~667 words per blog)</li><li>Apr-Jun: 16962 (~807 words per blog)</li><li>Jul-Sep: 17049 (~741 words per blog)</li><li>Oct-Dec: 28606 (~ words per blog)</li></ul><p>Damn that's a lot of words, to think that I used to hate writing. And there might be some that are over 1000 words, which is considered a lot of words by me in the past. In the past, I couldn't really talk to anyone, so topics usually build up in the back of my mind, it is quite nice I finally get to express them somewhere. Though I sometimes worry if I am oversharing.</p><p>Now that I think of it, perhaps I should announce my blog of the year...</p><center><h1 style="border:3px solid;display:inline-block;padding:5px;border-radius:5px">Dream where I committed arson and died <span class="blogdate">( 12 Feb 2024 )</span></h1></center><p>That dream is seriously fun, despite how many times I nearly died (and I got killed in the end anyway). The fact I somehow decided to commit arson because I got sick of killers going after me. I often think about this dream.</p><hr><h2>Website</h2><p>Honestly there are so many changes in my site this year, it is difficult to talk about them all. So I'll just talk about the ones I feel the most special.</p><p>My favourite change in this site is the JS for the blogs. I used to use iframes to show the past blog sections, but I noticed using them causes a bit of lag, and also scroll window inside a scroll window is a bit clumsy to use. I noticed I can use fetch() to get the contents of the code instead. However, using this can fuck up the JS code a bit. Moreover, I wanted to add a tag system to search for certain topics faster. So not only I need to modify my JS code for the collapsibles and other stuff, I also needed to figure out the filter system, what is wrong with me? Anyways, I somehow managed to code the thing, though it sometimes breaks when I add new stuff (I actually noticed it broke today), it is quite helpful.</p><p>Another cool thing I implemented is the Food Log I made on November. It's been a month I made that page, and I'm still very proud of the design, like it looks good in both computer and mobile!</p><hr><h2>Art</h2><p>You know every year end, artists tend to make those art summary showcasing their art in every month? I also made this, but in HTML format. <a href="/art/2024summary.html" target="_blank">Click here to view!</a></p><p>I actually drew quite a lot this year, it is perhaps caused by the inspiration boost back in 2023 October. I basically started drawing non-stop, and comparing my art in January and December, I think there's a bit of improvement, right?</p><p>On the beginning of the year, I wasn't as familiar with alcohol markers. And as I experiemented using them more, especially during Artfight, I felt more comfortable drawing with them, I must say it is one of my top fav art media now.</p><p>Speaking of Artfight, I found it amazing even under the summer term, I managed to finish 73 attacks, that's so many artists getting their OCs drawn! Can I do more next year, can't tell, but I will surely participate in it again.</p><h2>OCs</h2><p>I have lost track of what new lore I added this year, even though I know a lot of stuff has been added. But perhaps the part I developed the most is the RS gang, they (except Bun) got their refs this year, I also wrote a bit about their clan Lum- uhh- Luminescence? Man I almost forgot to spell. The Luminescence isn't part of the main story for now, but I believe it is quite important for the world-building, it can help describe the state of Stardust Isle and the hopelessness of the people living there.</p><p>One thing quite important about the development of RS is my stupid brainrot over Claire x Jaspers. Like I like this ship a normal amount on the first half of 2024, but when I saw Past the Stargazing Season's lyrics, which highkey matched their lore, I couldn't stop listening to it. I swear I listened to this song and its covers way more than my other favourite songs like Curses and Laplace's Angel this year.</p><p>I also added Wolf as a new character. While there isn't a lot of info about him yet, him and Raven should be quite important in terms of the plot development. As I have mentioned in Mira's bio, she was the leader of Sky Pioneers. And after her passing, there's a whole new set of members, with Raven being part of the team. The new Sky Pioneers, which will be the antagonists, will serve as the path to uncover the hidden stories of the world, and the pasts of Mira and Lavender. Also, I really wanted to develope Wolf and Raven more, because they kinda the comic relief characters, which is quite new here. Moreover, I feel like if Raven meets Ruth, he will make fun of her height like <a href="https://youtu.be/ZjlYFWLUDBQ?si=DkQ5Uyos54KNUOcX&t=58" target="_blank">the song perception check</a>, though I feel kinda bad for writing a guy called Raven (which is an awesome name) into a dick.</p><hr><h2>Life</h2><p>If I try to count the interesting stuff that happened this year, it is probably more than 5, which is a lot IMO. One cool thing is that I made Cosmos and Lavender plush, and whenever I go to school, I always bring Cosmos out. I don't know if bringing little dolls outside is something people normally do, but in a way Cosmos plush became a mental support for me.</p><p>I think the most remarkable event this year is the time I finally hanged out with my old friend, which is yesterday. It is something I always wanted to do for years, but it is only this year I've got the courage to invite him to eat lunch together. It feels more bittersweet than the normal happiness, I realised after 8 years of not seeing each other, our appearances drastically changed, and we don't chat IRL comfortably like we used to. Well, there's no use blaming myself for not inviting him to hang out more in the past, as I wasn't in a good mental state back then, it still feels a bit sad we aren't as close as we used to be.</p><hr><p>Do I have any resolutions? Ehhh not really, maybe I'll just keep on drawing and stuff. I hope life does go easier on me, my mental state still struggles a bit. And the fact I am able to invite my friend to hang out, it probably means I am less shy now, I hope that means something good will happen to me more.</p><center><h1>May you have a awesome year</h1></center></div><p class="date">( 31 Dec 2024 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../e.js"></script><script src="../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
