Well until something interesting happened just now.</p><p>After a class ended and I was chilling in the study room with my charging laptop and phone, I got a notification that I got a new comment in one of my blogs. I was quite excited, and went to see who commented.</p><p>And in the blog titled <a href="../2024/12-27.html" target="_blank">FOOD (27 Dec 2024)</a>, I found a suspicious comment made by Mary Molsen...</p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dbtaey0c7d4lfjb5bw2ig/Screenshot_at_10_20250211.jpg?rlkey=opay6ligcy1hwxrymha5lfk4t&st=th3ka9d6&raw=1"><p>The comment was... suspiciously bot-like, perhaps even made with genAI. And why the hell did this person link to a Chick-Fil-A menu website, does this company go on to random indie websites and advertise their food there? And a few minutes later, I got another comment, this time the linked website goes to a Tim Hortons menu website. The problem about Chick-Fil-A and Tim Hortons not even in Hong Kong aside, I don't think the websites are even the official ones.</p><p>I actually clicked into their websites (which isn't a good idea as idk if websites can contain malware), but I couldn't find anything that can scam people into paying their money to a fake restaurant. I'm pretty sure the website is made with genAI due to how unnatural the wordings are and how inconsistent the pages are (the locations page has the name terms-conditions, and the so-called contact forms can't be found).</p><p>I posted a message about this in some webhost website Discord servers, and someone mentioned the comment widget I'm using can be edited to have <a href="https://frills.dev/blog/231023-add-moderation-to-comment-widget/" target="_blank">moderation</a>. So I went ahead and implemented that, so currently all comments are hidden before I allow them to be shown, so at least other readers won't be able to see any harmful stuff.</p><p>However, it is quite sad to feel excited for someone to interact with me, only to realise said person is just a bot. I really like it when someone comments here, so if you are a real person, comment down the name of my blue catgirl OC and say whatever you want to tell me, I won't bite :3</p></div><p class="date">( 11 Feb 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
