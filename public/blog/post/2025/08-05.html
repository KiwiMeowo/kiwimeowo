A few days ago, there was a black rain alert, work would be cancelled if this alert is held before the work starting time. However, the HKO had the balls to increase the rain alert levels from yellow to black in the span of a few hours, and held the black rain warning at 9:13, which most people have already gone to work already. While I am lucky that the place I live isn't affected much by the rain, some people had to go to work while the streets are flooded. Honestly it's a common thing, because day offs mean the economy will be affected or smth, the HKO always avoids to hold work-cancelling alerts during working days, or that's what most of us think. Honestly if that's actually the case, what's the point of alerts, let us working people go outside and hope to not get washed away by the water!</p><p>Well today, the alerts were placed like intended. I woke up to a rather strong thunder, and I already knew the black rain alert was held even before I checked the phone. So I got to spend the whole day in my home instead of the quiet office, quite nice.</p><hr><h2>How's post-AF going?</h2><p>During AF, I spent every train ride and work breaks drawing attacks on my phone. Now that it's over, I feel very unused to the sudden change of habit, even though I found it quite tiresome during July.</p><p>I just finished the AF celebration drawing of this year. What is that you ask? It is an art I personally do after AF, I would draw something that is based off the attacks received. Last year, I received a couple of very cool attacks, some of them gave my OCs new accessories/outfits. I loved them so much, I decided to draw them. There are people who draw celebration art for successful game/story/event launches, so why not thank AF as well? I think the theme of the drawing I did this year isn't very clear, like I could've gave Cosmos the vest, what was I thinking?</p><hr><h2>Vent stuff</h2><p style="color:red">This section contains body insecurity, sexism, suicide and self-harm</p><p><span class="spoiler">I have a insecurity of being weak, I'm always told that being a woman is physicaly weaker than being a man. This always frustrated me, even if it's true, it feels that I am only seen as a thing to protect or to be assaulted. While this insecurity isn't as big as my other traumas, it lingers deep in my mind.</span></p><p><span class="spoiler">This worsened when I came across a comic (honestly there are so many medias containing this trope, but that one is the nail in the coffin), where a female character gets threatened by a man, but she couldn't get away because she was grabbed by the wrist, and he was too strong. The man only left her alone when a male character came. And apparently the message (or that's what I remembered) is that "Yea, women is physically weak." So, am I just supposed to move on and accept this, is there nothing I can do about it? Am I just going to be hurt by someone in the future, or wait for a man to protect me? I don't know what the point of that message is, I just felt extremely horrible afterwards.</span></p><p><span class="spoiler">I don't know if this is a form of body dysmorphia or something else, but I feel extremely terrified of my body and feminity sometimes, womanhood has been associated with weakness so much, I just hate it, hate it so much. I don't even want to be a guy, I just want to be seen as an independent person, not a prey or a precious porcelain doll. And instead of working out and trying fight classes, the only thing I want to do is hurt myself and jump off a building. It's pretty ironic that the minds of humans can backfire like this.</span></p><p><span class="spoiler">My mental state is a bit fucked since my period is coming soon, which is the time I'm least mentally well. It's kinda hard to stay away from self-harm urges, and there isn't a lot of helpful resources I can find right now. Anyways, I feel a little better, after my body froze from the fear for an hour that is.</span></p><hr><p>The black rain alert lasted far longer than usual, but it did went down. Tomorrow, everything should be back to usual (unless the streets are badly damaged and we can't enter), and I will have to work again. I feel like I have written significantly less blogs this summer, I have ran out of topics to ramble about. Well, at least I hope I survive this sudden insecurity I have for the time being.</p><p class="date">( 5 Aug 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
