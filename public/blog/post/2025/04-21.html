They allow me to do mundane stuff repeatedly. I feel like my concept of fun is quite interesting, I enjoy a bit of repetition sometimes, it calms my mind.</p><p>As a child, I enjoy playing with toys to roleplay and pretend to do daily life stuff, like pretending to go to school or hang out with friends. As far as I am aware, it is normal and healthy child behavior. But honestly, it is very fun, it is worth talking about. In Minecraft, I built a lot of buildings, aside from my own house, I also built restaurants, schools, and other public facilities. When I am satisfied, I like to pretend I am living in the world and go on my daily life. When I wake up from the bed, I'll pretend to dress myself up with armor, go to school on foot or by minecart, attend class and grab my books, go home, eat and sleep. I also complete the activities on a specific time of day, like I'd arrive at school when the clock is pointing at a specific point, and I'd go home when the clock hits soon or something. I don't like going to school, but pretending to go to school in Minecraft is kinda soothing.</p><p>I haven't played Minecraft very much due to my motion sickness. A better and more recent example would be Sims. I played the Sims ever since I was a child, the mobile version of the Sims to be specific. My favourite way of playing this game is to start a relationship with the guy with the best house, then stay there without actually moving in with him, because I'd get to eat food without paying anything. I also always befriend the woman with twintails, any characters with twintails were automatically my best friend.</p><p>More recently, I played the Sims 4 last year. I made my OCs and myself staying in one house. And I only did very normal stuff, like earning money, decorating my house and stuff. I made Kyrea cook food and sell to people, she nearly froze to death. However, I did not do anything absurdly evil stuff like many people did, even though it does sound fun. I really enjoy playing Sims to just, experience an ordinary life? It's hard to explain why I like this feeling, but yea it's relaxing.</p><p>I also quite enjoyed playing Scribblenauts, especially with the item Maxwell's notebook. It summons random items, and that was how I learnt new words. I always wished to make my own house in the game, but building one is very difficult, using wood planks as walls is the best I could do, doors couldn't even work very well. I remember allocating different sections of the free-play map and setting them as certain rooms, then I would place different furnitures, pretending I am living in a house. I also liked to place nuclear bombs, kill everyone in the vicinity, and doing it over and over again, but that is less important.</p><p>I think I should try playing Sims and Scribblenauts again later, they are very fun.</p></div><p class="date">( 21 Apr 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
