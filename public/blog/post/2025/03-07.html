And wow, why did I take so long to listen to this.</p><p>The first impression of this song is the emoticon ^q^. I haven't seen this emoticon been used since 2018 or so, when horny fans unhingedly thirst over their favourite character/ship, it is a funny expression. I'm not very interested in the theme of cannibalism in fiction, like cannibalism as a metaphor for love or unhealthy relationships. Eating your loved one? <a href="https://youtu.be/iLJNSD3H5sg?si=HPVckcsd18intNIF" target="_blank">But love shouldn't cost an arm or a leg!</a>. But the fact I see this occasionally while scrolling Twitter gives me an impression that I should listen to it sometime, so today I gave it a try.</p><p>The song is horribly catchy, the singer (which is a voicebank, I'm surprised the singer isn't a human) sounds like she's craving for human flesh so badly. The fact there's Chinese lyrics is also a pleasant surprise, I haven't really listened to newer Chinese songs (Cantonese or Mandarin) in a while, I certainly didn't think this song would not only have Mandarin included, but also blend it with English so well.</p><p>The part where Yi Xi starts screaming about wanting to tear apart and devour whoever she's singing to is my favourite part. There's just something satisfying about voicebanks having expressions in their voice, especially like how in this song, it feels like Yi Xi is going mad from wanting to eat flesh so badly. The lyrics are so well written, like "I NEED TO BE YOUR AFTERLIFE". A little funny thing I noticed is the song used that "huh?" sound effect commonly used in Chinese Tiktok clips.</p><p>Aside from that part, I also like this lyrics of this part:</p><blockquote><p style="text-indent:0">Oh, your heart<br>Aortic work of art<br>My love, my knife<br>To carve it out, your life</p></blockquote><p>This part sounds very beautiful, if you ignore the lyrics, it sounds like something out of a love song, like talking about how beautiful the heart is.</p><p>I'm not sure if this song is about cannibalism as a metaphor for love, it's more like cannibalism as an act for love, the singer just love to eat human flesh I guess. I see a comment saying this song might not just be cannibalism though:</p><blockquote><p>Some people think that this song is solely about cannibalism, but I don't believe that to be the case. If you didn't know, "vanity" means someone's pride, accomplishments, and admiration. So "Butcher Vanity" means to butcher said person's pride and achievements.</p><p>But the song doesn't really state "butcher's vanity" or anything else, but "butcher's *vein*." And that they're preying on it. I think this song is more about the protagonist's ego and how obsessed they are with themselves. At 2:02 there is literally a shot of them eating themself.</p><p>At 2:08 we can literally see the protagonist swinging a knife at herself, meaning the heart that she is eating in this frame is likely her own (metaphorically), and that she is incredibly caught up in herself. 3:03 literally confirms this as well.</p><p style="text-indent:0">@upcomingperson4098</p></blockquote><p>Whatever the actual meaning behind this song is, it doesn't change the fact thing song slaps so hard. Man I'm going to loop this song for a while.</p></div><p class="date">( 7 Mar 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
