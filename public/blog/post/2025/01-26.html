And the moment I saw it, this cute little plush has struck my heart.</p><hr><p>I think I can be considered to be quite a plush lover, whenever I see a plush that is very soft and cute, it is extremely difficult for me to just leave it. I have two big hamster plushes, despite being a bit pricey (under HKD$500), I impulsively bought them, though I don't really regret it. Aside from these two, I have many plushes that I bought impulsively, I mean they are just too cute to be ignored.</p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/l8x27v0nn2kx27svy497c/hampters_2025-Jan-26.jpg?rlkey=kfhsa6986zevdlmri6pgpdskx&st=6jnscszr&raw=1"><center>Old photo of my hamster plushes and my hamster Cucumber</center><p>Ok back to the cabbage dog subject, this plush and another white dog plush is placed beside the clothing bin, which isn't unusual considering it is lunar new year soon and house-cleaning is a tradition of this festival. However, these plushes stood out because they are extremely clean and new-looking, their little blushes haven't even faded (my hamster plushes had blushes that faded over time). Also, they are SO CUTEEEE, like I could see the cabbage dog plush staring at me with cute eyes, it was so hard to resist.</p><p>Since the people who put them here doesn't want them anymore, pretty sure it is fine if I just take them, and I did. So now, I have two extra plushes hanging out in my room.</p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3crj8tn57pd21m23tbxm9/ezgif_5_81b1965e5b_2025-Jan-26.jpg?rlkey=9z1eeeafsjru4rhquca4j4akj&st=ay49wdwt&raw=1"><center>"Just the two of us (Just the two of us)"</center><p>Ough precious lil guys</p></div><p class="date">( 26 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
