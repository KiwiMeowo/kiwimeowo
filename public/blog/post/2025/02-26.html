But to be honest, Solar's existence feels longer than that. Probably because of how unusually she is created.</p><p>To explain what I mean, I should spilt the timeline of building UtSS into multiple parts. I would call them Dream&Reality period (Mira and Lavender are the protagonists, also the earliest time period), Humanoid Cometling period (Where I first created Cosmos and a world of humanoid cometlings), the Lost Heroes period (Building the idea of travellers who venture into the Voided Lands to save the world), and the current period, where I'm trying to tie everything together.</p><p>Solar is created in the Lost Heroes period, to compare, the very basis of Claire and Grey are created far before UtSS existed, Jaspers and Bun are created during the Humanoid Cometling period. However, the base of RS is created during the Lost Heroes period, and Solar is the first member. That is what I meant by <u>"She is kinda created before this gang, but to some degree, she might be considered as created after them..."</u> in her bio.</p><hr><p>So back in that era, Solar was originally planned to be one of the people who are investigating the Voided Lands. She was one of the strongest travellers, and is very adventurous and kind, big sister kind of vibe.</p><p>Also, cometlings are a bit more common during that time, they aren't everywhere, but there's more than one. Using the cometling's power, they can study the land and maybe heal the dying world.</p><p>Eventually, in the dark woods, Solar finds a cometling, as old as the land the people are living in. And slowly, the two became friends. However, as they learn about each other, they would also discover something sinister, in Solar's team, the world, and their powers...</p><hr><p>And like many things, the part about a professional team travelling to the Voided Lands is scrapped, because I can't find much reason for anyone rational to go there. But what if I tell you, there are also many things about Solar's current story that also matches her old one? I mean, she did go to the Voided Lands with her friends, surely something should happen there!</p><p>I hope the next time I write a birthday blog, I get to share some cool OC updates. But for now, let's put the birthday art here. While I don't know what the other RS members would gift Solar, I think Claire would give her something related to cats.</p><p>Fun fact: I often imagine Solar to be a dog person, until she played with a cat and she absolutely falls in love with cats. Who can resist cats, really?</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8j682g64e8olhxph9x7mc/IMG_3114_20250226.jpg?rlkey=eaybrfpnl9865lf5i6p1gflow&st=l12s5atd&raw=1" alt="Birthday art for Solar, with little doodles of Grey, Claire, Bun and Jaspers"><p class="date">( 26 Feb 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
