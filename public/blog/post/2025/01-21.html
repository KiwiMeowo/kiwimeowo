My tongue has a hard time tolerating strong sensations, like soda and high/low temperatures.</p><p>I never liked soda since I was a child, I never understood the hype around it. The fizz made by the carbonated drink makes me mouth hurt, it is hard to believe people enjoyed that feeling. It's also quite sad everytime I see a drink that looks so tasty, maybe it is mango flavoured or smth, and it turns out that it is carbonated.</p><p>As I grow older, I have been trying to drink soda, because there are many cases where I buy a meal and it comes with free soda (and changing to non-carbonated drinks costs extra). I noticed my mouth can tolerate it better now, however it still takes me hours to finish the soda, as I take tiny sips to not let the fizz hurt me, like how you sip very hot water.</p><p>Speaking of, my mouth don't tolerate really hot water as well. While you might say "Isn't it normal that hot water hurts mouths?" While it is, I was often baffled by how my mom drinks hot water at the temperature I consider undrinkable. My mom says she just got used to it, or maybe she just sips slowly, but honestly I'd rather just let it cool.</p><p>I prefer drinking cold water more than hot water, it doesn't make me throat feel funny, and it tastes better. However, if it is too cold, I'd actually want to let it warm closer to room temperature, because I think a drink tastes better when it is just slightly cooler than room temperature, not straight-out-of-the-fridge cold. Sometimes when I take my drinks out of the fridge, I end up forgetting it and it completely goes back to room temperature... Not that I mind too much, room temp drinks are alright.</p><p>One thing I used to be sensitive of is mint toothpaste. Maybe it is a common thing, as children toothpaste is a thing. I still remember the days I tried mint toothpaste and my mouth goes sensory overload because the taste of mint is just so strong. I don't exactly remember when I switched from children's toothpaste to mint ones, I think one day I just wanna try it again and got used to it more and more.</p><p>One thing my mouth is surprisingly ok about is popping candy. When I was a child, I was quite concerned how it's called Exploding Candy in Chinese. But when I ate it, I was fascinated by the sensation instead of feeling awful, it was quite tasty. The sensation of eating popping candy is far less strong than soda, but considering how sensitive I was, that was unexpecting.</p><p>My mouth has gotten stronger, and now I can drink cola. But tbh cola tastes mid.</p><p class="date">( 21 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
