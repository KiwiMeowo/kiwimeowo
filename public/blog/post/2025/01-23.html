[EXTREMELY LOUD INCORRECT BUZZER]</p><p>Also, I have a feeling that I already have talked about prosopagnosia (Face blindness), but I can't find mentions of this word anywhere, I might have missed tho.</p><hr><p>Prosopagnosia is a condition where the person has difficulty recognising faces, they might have difficulty differentiate other people's faces, even those who are close to that person. And for me, I also have a mild case of pros- progn- pr- ...face blindness.</p><p>How I found out I have it is very funny though, I learnt about it from a playthrough of<u> Zero Escape 999</u>. There is a scene where a character explains this condition. When she said something along the lines of "People with prosopagnosia can't distinguish different faces, like how most people can't differentiate different monkeys", I really felt it matches my situation a lot. Even though the representation isn't exactly positive, it at least gave me the knowledge to learn a bit more about myself.</p><p>Ever since I'm young, I tend to mix up people. There's a time I thought two students are the same person until I saw two of them side by side, and a time I asked a group of girls to take care of my belongings and ended up asking the wrong group of girls for my stuff back. Moreover, it takes years for me to remember who is who in a class, or maybe I never even remember them.</p><p>While different people with face blindness have different experiences, my personal experience with it is that I can recognise certain types of faces, but it is easy for me to mix them up. For example, there is a tall, big guy with a beard in front of me, and I can probably remember his face. However, if there is multiple tall guys with beards in front of me, I will start having trouble. There are some classmates I had that have unique features, and I can remember them very easily. But there are many guys here that is just black short hair, glasses and random shirt, and it is so difficult to remember them D:. And during primary and secondary school, when I am somehow chosen to distribute papers, I always have trouble doing my task because I don't know who is who. There are teachers who think it is strange that one can't recognise a classmate of six years, and I feel embarrassed :(</p><p>The entire time I thought it was my skill issue that I can't differentiate them, I thought it would be easier for me to remember their faces if I have looked at their faces more (This might have contributed to my face blindness though, just not the cause). But after learning about face blindness, it brought me a bit of relief, knowing that it isn't entirely my fault. I guess that's why representation is important, adding new knowledge and caring for certain audiences while giving entertainment.</p><hr><h2>So how do I cope with it?</h2><p>There are a few things that can help me differentiate different people: Clothing and features other than appearance.</p><p>Clothing is perhaps the most obvious feature to focus on aside from faces. If I have seen them the same day and I will meet them again, I will try to remember what they are wearing. This is useful during one-day activities. And while it is less useful when I have to meet my classmates again and again, as they tend to not wear the same clothes... but there's exceptions. In university, I see some people who wear the same colored clothes every day, while I don't know why they did that, but it is unintentionally helpful to me. There are also people who wears the same shirt every day? Do they have multiple of the same shirt? Or do they just wear it every day? Not sure.</p><p>If clothing isn't a reliable visual cue, like the people-change-clothes thing, or you are in a school and people wear uniforms, another helpful thing is other features like voices and body language. While voices often times can sound similar, it is less likely for two similar-looking people to have similar voices as well. There are a few times I managed to distinguish two people using their voices!</p><p>For body language, it can be used when I'm trying to find someone among a sea of strangers. Suppose I'm trying to find my sister, while there are plenty of people that might look like her, but I know if she sees me, she will interact with me instead of walking away. Also, if the way a person acts is unique, it can be a clue to distinguish them. While most people act the same, I knew one friend who stands out from other people. One time, I was walking on the street, and I saw a familiar figure across the road. While I couldn't get a good view to her face, the way she walked and looked around the shops just makes me think "Yup, that's definitely her". And yes I was correct.</p><hr><p>Ok writing this really makes me think I have mentioned this somewhere, but idk if it's in my blogs. So if I actually repeated this topic, I hope you don't mind a rewrite lol.</p></div><p class="date">( 23 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
