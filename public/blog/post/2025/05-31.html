I guess all the alcohol I've drank yesterday made me had a weird ass dream, or maybe my brain was just feeling inspired.</p><hr><p>The dream started with a Cookie Run update (it didn't specify which one), and apparently Pome was very important in the story. For some reason, she was extremely obsessed with Dark Enchantress that update, like ten times the normal amount. I think other things happened but like always I never pay attention to anything not Pome related.</p><p>Later I encountered a fluffy bee flying near me, I noticed its antenna has something stuck to it, so I helped removing it. After that, the bee flew into my hair, snuggling against my neck. It was very fluffy and I giggled, it felt like my hamster climbing on my shoulder.</p><p>Later on, I met a dog, probably a golden retriever. I approached it and it bit me very badly. I didn't bleed or lose a finger, but I was extremely hurt by the betrayal, I thought it was a good dog :(</p><p>Anyways, apparently all these time I was travelling with Pome, we went to various places in a somewhat rural area. We didn't chat much, and she was a bit annoyed at me the whole time, I didn't mind though. Anyways, when we got to a construction site, there was a strange smell, and I immediately thought the gas must be toxic. So I quickly left that area... by lying down and rolling down the slope. When I got to the bottom, I noticed my belongings got flinged out of my pocket, I panickedly tried to gather my stuff, oh thank god my wallet is over here... Wait.</p><p>There's two of them...? When I got all of my stuff back, I noticed all of them had been duplicated. I checked the inside and the details, all identical. Within the strange scenario, the first and only conclusion I got was that my universe and an alternate one got merged, and there's another me who's panicking that her stuff all went missing. Instead of thinking that I got extra money, I only felt bad that another me lost all her money, so I decided to find a way to give them back. I didn't know where to start though, I figured if I tell this to the public, they would either think I'm insane, or the government would stop me from speaking about it because it is too dangerous to let the public know I guess.</p><p>Apparently the extra wallet case was an animated series, where all the characters are animals (kinda like jewelpet). While the premise is very cool, there's a character that I extremely dislike, I would describe this character "the creep that is somehow the love interest and everyone ships them for some reason", this type of character exists in real life media by the way. So yea I wouldn't watch that series even if you pulled a gun on me.</p><hr><p>So I woke up at 4am, and I decided to write them down, which is a good call since I've already forgotten most of the details now. However, this will not be the only dream of that night.</p><p>Me and a bunch of people similar to my age went to a hospital, probably just visiting a future work area or whatever. Me and another girl went a bit further than the rest of the group, and when us two got to a room, suddenly there was a lockdown, and all the doors are shut. There was a virus outbreak where people get turned into violent monsters, and I guess the hospital detected that one of the group members is infected. I was wondering if one of the members from the back turned into a monster and started killing the other people, but there's something else more worrying. There was a poster on the wall, saying "Anything/anyone who are suspected to be infected by the virus or had contact with the virus will be incinerated", so yea everyone in the hospital is in danger, and me and the girl with me decided to make an escape.</p><p>I don't remember exactly how we left the hospital, but we got out and found ourselves at a harbour. Fortunately, we have super powers. In our group, each one of us have one of three powers: Super strength, super speed, and flight, I have the third one. So I grabbed the girl, and tried my best to fly past the ocean. When I looked around, I noticed the remaining group also escaped, with the flying people struggling to hold onto their non-flying friends and trying not to fall.</p><p>We eventually landed in a train, finally able to rest a bit. Unfortunately, the destination of the train is destruction, the train got cut into pieces and thrown into the landfill along with us inside. I luckily survived, but I couldn't find my team, and there were a lot of strangers who also boarded the train and suffered awful injuries, like having a pole stuck on the shoulder. While they looked painful, I couldn't help but question why their injuries look so symmetrical.</p><hr><p>So I guess the second dream left me on a cliffhanger. Honestly, I am quite happy I had two interesting dreams in a row, I missed having dreams like these.</p><p class="date">( 31 May 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
