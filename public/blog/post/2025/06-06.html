Though I had extremely little time to play this chapter due to internship, I throughly enjoyed the story.</p><hr><p>So the story starts with Raspberry, Wildberry and Tiger Lily trying to find Hollyberry in the Heart of Paradise, and on the way, Tiger Lily finds a tree with unripe berries. Despite a resident of the paradise warning her how tart and sour the berries are, Tiger Lily determined that the berries are worth gathering.</p><p>The POV changes to Hollyberry, who has just woken up. Surprisingly, Eternal Sugar didn't have the intention to take away the soul jam, but its shine has faded away. Eternal Sugar continues to convince Hollyberry to abandon her passion and join her Happiness, and offers a "gift". But before that, she is interrupted by Pavlova Cookie, who mentions there's a vistor for the berries of the Heart. Eternal Sugar, who seems to already know who the visitor is, leaves Hollyberry for the time being.</p><p>And yup, the visitor is Shadow Milk Cookie, disguised as a lady gathering berries for a student. From the short interaction, it seems the two has a somewhat negative relationship, as Shadow Milk pulled a few pranks on Eternal Sugar, including turning her angels into jesters and making them jump over fiery coals, and tricking a cookie into falling by spreading a rumor that her garden is located at the bottom of a cliff. Well people always felt bad for Shadow Milk feeling lonely, but honestly at this point I think he (she? idk what pronouns to use here) deserved it, like bro what did you expect when you did all that awful stuff.</p><p>Shadow Milk then warns Eternal Sugar to ease up on her other half, being so obsessive with Hollyberry will only scare her away. However, Eternal Sugar is determined that Hollyberry is hers, forever and ever... Damn that's gay as well. This scene really feels like Shadow Milk is being bitter about his breakup with Pure Vanilla (even though Shadow Milk is the one who rejected Pure Vanilla), bro is waiting for Eternal Sugar's downfall.</p><p>While Eternal Sugar is away, Hollyberry decides it would be a chance to escape. She asks Pavlova to let her go out for a walk, which he agrees. They continued the discussion on why there is a void in Hollyberry's heart, Hollyberry believes her happiness can't be achieved through love, but instead it's only when her heart is empty that she could feel happiness, she says love could not give her happiness... Like, damn D:. Sugarfly Cookie comes in saying there are intruders, which are Wildberry, Tiger Lily and Raspberry. When Sugarfly decides to deal with the intruders, Hollyberry decides to lie wanting to help her, as Holly wants to gather with her allies, which Sugarfly and Pavlova somehow agree.</p><p>On the way meeting the three cookies, Sugarfly explains her story on how her wish was granted by Eternal Sugar. In the past, she was unhappy with how dull her wings were, and wished they were adorned with colors. Eternal Sugar granted her wish by covering them with syrup, but that also means she cannot fly anymore. Despite that, Sugarfly seems to be perfectly fine with it, extremely grateful even.</p><p>Hollyberr manages to meet up with her allies, however there's another surprise. Eternal Sugar seems to have transported the people of Hollyberry Kingdom to this realm, and all of them are fully under her spell. They are fully satisfied with the paradise, and their passion is replaced with content and sloth. When Hollyberry tells them to snap out of it, they instead complains about how stressful it was to deal with their problems and live in a kingdom with dragons potentially destroying everything. They were also mad how Hollyberry left the kingdom and caused one of the princesses to be abducted by a dragon, which really hurted Hollyberry. At this point, Hollyberry does not have the courage to take them out of this paradise, maybe putting them in eternal happiness is better...?</p><p>Tiger Lily, who just gathered the unripe berries, meets Jungleberry and Royalberry (which are her parents, but she does not know). When the couple notices Tiger Lily, they mentions she might be around the age of Princess Cookie and their missing daughter, and mourned how they wished to reunite with their missing daughter. Feeling bad for the two, Tiger Lily feeds them the berries, which the two gets surprised by how sour the berries are. Somehow, the sourness breaks the curse, and they act normally now.</p><p>Sugarfly then takes Hollyberry and her allies to a land full of jars, which contain cookies peacefully sleeping in jam. The trapped cookies are forever contained in happiness, all passion faded away. Even though how happy they look, it's just so messed up Hollyberry realises Eternal Sugar's way of happiness might not be good for them. Sugarfly feels perplexed on how they don't want to accept Eternal Sugar's love, so a fight breaks out between them.</p><p>After Hollyberry's team defeats Sugarfly with a jar lid as a shield, Sugarfly feels shocked about her loss even with her wings. But that's exactly why Sugarfly couldn't fight well, her movements are weighed down by the syrup covering her wings. Sugarfly keeps saying how she hated how dull her wings were before, but she slowly remembers how much she loved to freely fly. Realising her desire, she spreads open her butterfly wings, the hardened syrup cracking open. And with that, Sugarfly breaks out of her curse, finally remembering her passion to fly. Though her wings are injured from cracks, there is a chance that she can be finally free, when Eternal Sugar is dealt with of course.</p><p>Tiger Lily feeds everyone the unripe berries, and the people are all out of the curse, even Hollyberry's mind after all the manipulation she endured is cleared. Unfortunately, Eternal Sugar is back, being somewhat mad that Hollyberry wants to face her head on. She turns multiple cookies into statues, which makes Hollyberry realise the statues she saw were used to be living cookies. Tiger Lily, Wildberry, Raspberry, Hollyberry, and the new ally: Sugarfly goes on the battle against Eternal Sugar... Then they quickly get taken away by vines.</p><p>When Hollyberry woke up, she find her allies to be contained in jars, peacefully sleeping. However, Eternal Sugar offers a deal that they get to leave the paradise safely, which is to eat the Berry of All Pains. The fruit contains all the pain from the people in the paradise, when eaten, the sweetness on the cookie will be removed, removing the risk of being targeted by monsters. But Hollyberry has to think of a question: Does she really want to make her loved ones go back to a world full of pain? Does she want to risk everyone being killed by monsters and beasts? Hollyberry has seen the people she cared about being hurt, sometimes indirectly caused by herself. She felt so guilty about being unable to protect them, she doesn't want to take away that happiness.</p><p>But then, Hollyberry remembers the true voices of her loved ones, she remembers how passionate her people are, how much her people believes in Hollyberry, and how cookies still choose passion and freedom instead of staying in eternal sloth. Then, Hollyberry finally meets the Voice of Passion again, Hollyberry admits she is a coward who can't face reality, and she worries she will run away from her problems again. But the Voice of Passion reminds that even after running away, she always choose to pick up her shield again and fight, because how much her allies and friends care for her, and how much Hollyberry cares for her friends. Remembering the passion and love, Hollyberry decides to eat the berry.</p><p>Though Eternal Sugar is the one who gave her the berry, it is more of a tactic to manipulate Hollyberry further. And the fact Hollyberry eats the berry, Eternal Sugar panicks, BADLY. Instead of suffering pain worth billions, Hollyberry instead gains her awakened form (and we get to view a short moment of naked Hollyberry, nice), and a brand new shield. The kind exterior of Eternal Sugar shatters, her expression becomes panicked and scared, threatening Hollyberry that she and her people will face unbearable pain over and over again. Hollyberry which replied, with a happy expression never seen before, that she will rise back with every pain, because after every pain, there is true happiness and love.</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/eirwzozyis76p9vhh659e/IMG_4025.jpg?rlkey=z3vcnga88gr5501o3hr5h6f4h&raw=1"><center>ough,,, so precious</center><p>Eternal Sugar snaps completely, everything around is rotting away, she attacks the team, but this time she cannot break Hollyberry's shield. Eternal Sugar very baffled about Hollyberry leaving this paradise, but Hollyberry knows now that it's impossible to have happiness without pain. "You and I both know that Happiness cannot exists without Pain as its shadow. One day, you might realize that it is you who is lying to herself. And perhaps then, we could be two halves of a soul, destined to complete one another." Damn after everything, Hollyberry is willing to call Eternal Sugar her other half, yuri is real.</p><p>Eternal Sugar then begs Hollyberry to stay, even saying "Don't leave" over and over again, god damn this shit scary. The paradise crumbles along with Eternal Sugar's mind, debris falling everywhere as she maniacally laughs. A rubble nearly falls onto Eternal Sugar, instead of escaping, Hollyberry rushes back...</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/08e5f8hvzsk7qdxq9htmt/IMG_4030_20250607.JPG?rlkey=eufbgha5941aydsaali2epi9b&raw=1"><center>It should've been meee, IT SHOULD'VE BEEN MEEEEEEEE</center><p>God I wish I were Eternal Sugar. Despite everything, Hollyberry decides to protect Eternal Sugar, she might be leaving the paradise, she promised to meet again. Wow... That's so yuriful??</p><p>At the end, Pavlova rants about how pathetic Sugarfly is trying to fly and escape this paradise, but he also how empty it is to stay in the paradise, without her. He suddenly grows into an adult, lamenting that he is eternally bound to this place...</p><hr><p>Ok I do not know much Greek mythology, the only thing I know is the Pisces zodiac story is based of Eros and Venus. While I don't know what the battle between Hollyberry and Eternal Sugar is based off, I know the dynamic between Pavlova and Sugarfly is based of Eros and Psyche. To make it simple, Eros is the cupid, who was originally ordered by Venus (which Eternal Sugar is based off) to kill Psyche, he instead falls for the mortal girl, turning into an adult. Psyche is a beautiful girl who endured many trials by Venus, she eventually died, but is revived by Eros' kiss, she becomes immortal. But for Pavlova and Sugarfly, there is no happy ending between them, while Sugarfly gains her freedom, Pavlova is still trapped, and he realises his love for Sugarfly the moment she left. God damn the angst just keeps going.</p><p>I actually haven't mentioned the costumes. There is two costumes for Hollyberry and Eternal Sugar each, taking place in an alternate timeline where Hollyberry accepts Eternal Sugar's sloth. First of all, in the trailer, it is implied that Hollyberry kissed Eternal Sugar???? Second of all, when you equip Hollyberry's sloth costume, her voice becomes noticeably less enthusiastic. Not only many of her dialogs has changed meaning completely, her skill voiceline becomes weaker. Normally when I use her skill, her powerful voice is louder than most other skill voices. However, when I was playing Beast Raid with Hollyberry and other cookies, her skill voice seems to got covered by the other voicelines, which I found confusing. I placed Hollyberry alone in the story mode, and her voice, indeed, has become hesitant and weaker, and it is genuinely heartbreaking. Like, Hollyberry this isn't you :(. And if you read the costume story, even if you ship EternalHolly, you can't deny their ship becomes horribly wrong when Hollyberry chooses to stay in her paradise. I mean, I actually like this ship a lot, the dynamic is very interesting, and fucked up, fucked up ships doesn't mean I won't ship them, and the fact I ship them doesn't mean I won't admit this can go very toxic.</p><p>I remember the fandom becoming extremely impatient about the pride month art coming out late. But honestly I interpreted this update as the pride month update, like seriously there is so much romantic undertones between Holly and Eternal Sugar. Hollyberry becoming flustered around Eternal Sugar, ES calling Hollyberry her love (she actually said that????), the scene where Hollyberry shields ES and ES hopelessly sworns over Holly????? Ok is this even "implied" romance? That's just straight up romance.</p><p>Ranking all the beasts stories, I think I will put this one on the very top, I think all the beasts stories are done quite well so far. While Shadow Milk's story might rank the lowest, I still think it was quite entertaining, especially how Shadow Milk tricked Pure Vanilla into thinking his entire life is a lie. I hope White Lily's story won't be fumbled, her release update got over-shadowed (heh) by Shadow Milk and the shipping wars, she deserves to have her own story this time.</p><p>Last but not least, I get to see Hollyberry's arms. Like gyatt damn, I love muscular women, and I love her buff arms.</p><p class="date">( 6 Jun 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
