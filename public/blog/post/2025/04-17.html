I don't have to worry about failing the summer term anymore.</p><p>To briefly explain what's going on, the next summer term will be us working under an internship position relevant to our program. So recently, we have been gathered to prepare, like organising our CV and applying to companies. I didn't expect much about this summer term, like I mentioned on <a href="02-20.html">this blog</a>, I feel less anxious about getting a job now. My teacher has the older students got an internship in the past summer terms, so I wasn't too worried, though I don't know how true that was. I applied to five or so companies, but only one send me a video interview, and apparently all my other classmates got it, so I wasn't a special one I guess.</p><p>A few weeks later, my teachers gathered us together to talk about what you would expect while working in a company, and what we should prepare. Despite fearing jobs for the majority of my life, I was quite intrigued, it seems the company has quite high standards? My teacher also mentioned that the current economy is very harsh, and it would be more difficult for us to find one. At the end of the talk, I asked my teacher "Is it possible that some of us won't be able to find a job before summer term?" And he said maybe... ðŸ˜¨. He did say he believe I'm likely to get a job with my good looking CV, but considering I'm not in the top universities, and how I am not the hardcore type students, and the fact I don't join clubs/extracurricular activities, I was starting to worry.</p><p>After that talk, I received a call from a company I applied to. I was so shocked because it has been a while after I sent them an email, and they actually sent an interview invitation to someone else in the class few weeks ago, I thought I was not seen as a good candidate. My sister said that sometimes company might wait a while until they accept some applications. As excited I was, I went into panick mode, looking up the company details and what I should wear for the interview.</p><p>Luckily, I have a great sister. She took me around in a shopping mall and matched a suitable outfit for me. I was quite surprised how fast I found the right shoes for me, my shoe size is quite large (40-ish EU), but the store luckily has my size. Not gonna lie, I look quite good in suits, actually women should try wearing more suits, suits are hot.</p><hr><p>So fast forward to the day of interview, I have prepared for everything I think I need. I went out early, went on the route google map told me, hoping I don't accidentally go on the wrong bus. As for the interview, everything went decently, I arrived very early, every question the interviewers gave me I managed to answer them smoothly. While my CV isn't the most ideal, my IELTS result is quite good. At the end of the interview, they told me to wait for the second interview, which was a bummer since I wished to finish this in one day, like some of my classmates did.</p><p>A few days have past, my teacher asked me about the interview, I said it went smoothly, but haven't received any news. Well soon after I sent this message, I got a call from the company. I was expecting for a second interview, but instead, they said I can sign an contract with them. I was so shocked??? Like I'm pretty sure my other classmates have to meet the boss first or something, and some have to write an essay for something, which I didn't have to do. I'm confused, but I was very excited, I WON'T FAIL THE SUMMER TERM YIPEEEEEE</p><p>I worried about not getting an internship for so long, only for me to become one of the earliest classmates to get an internship, what a twist. Well I hope that I can finally understand how a job is like, maybe it will help me in building the world of Dreamland Workshop. I can finally focus on my exams now.</p><p class="date">( 17 Apr 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
