Then I realised I might have not mentioned this in my past blogs, so I figured it would be something nice to write about.</p><hr><p>So back in junior secondary school, when I was doing my own thing during class, my sight noticed something should've been glaring on my arms: Red spots were all over my arms. While these red spots sometimes appear after I showered, there shouldn't be this much. After talking about it with my classmates, I decided to visit the clinic, but the doctor there told me to visit a hospital instead. Somewhat annoying, but it shouldn't very bad, right?</p><p>After waiting for hours, I was told to take a blood sample. As I was waiting for the results, I was speculating what I was suffering from with my family, was it a skin condition, or the worse case scenario, leukemia? As I heard my name being called, I trotted (I like to run even when I don't need to rush) towards the room, only to be told to slow down and be careful. While it makes sense to not move too fast in hospitals, but there's another major reason I was told that: My platelet level was dangerously low. And they immediately sent me to another hospital (I forgot the reason but it has something to do with my being a minor at that time).</p><p>Having to stay in the hospital for the first time except when I was a baby was somewhat exciting, mostly because I didn't have to go to school. But the actual experience? Eh I don't like it very much. The food there wasn't very tasty, I especially don't like oatmeal. And there isn't a lot of things to do aside from scrolling my phone, or drawing. My family gave me some snacks, but for some reason I felt guilty eating chocolate in front of doctors and nurses.</p><p>A little funny bit is when the nurse attached a tube thing to my hand (for blood samples and treatment). The nurse asked me for my hand, I was expecting a blood transfution like last time, though I found it strange she was aiming at the back of my hand. After a few seconds of looking away (Even after all these years, I still can't look directly at the needle poking me), I felt strange that it's taking long than usual. When I moved my sight to my hand- Holy fuck there's blood everywhere. I guess it is just something that happens, after I cleaned up the blood, everything's normal and the tube is attached to my hand for the rest of my hospital stay.</p><hr><p>Honestly this experience isn't very interesting until I mention the part I received treatment. During that time, I was still in a cult called Jehovah's Witness (sorry for the sudden whiplash). While there's a lot of bad things about this cult, but one of things you aren't allowed to do there is blood donation/transfusion. You have a life-threatening condition and needs blood to survive? Then perish.</p><p>And guess what, the treatment I needed to receive back then is putting something in my blood, which is made of some sort immune cells from blood. Whatever blood that is, it might be violating the rules of JW. So I told that to the JW teacher, and luckily, she determined that this type of treatment is fine, considering it isn't fully blood. Not only that, she also brought many other JW people to visit me, it was quite nice for them to care about me.</p><p>But to be serious, this could've done SO badly if she said the treatment isn't okay. I would have to tell my family and doctors that I can't receive the treatment because I was stuck in a damn cult. While the likelihood of me actually rejecting the treatment is very low because I doubt my family would just let me die, I bet they would start a very big arguement with the JW people. While it might speed up the process of me leaving the cult, I don't really like starting drama.</p><p>Anyways, the day of the treatment was only annoying at most, because the entire day I have a IV bag attached to the tube stuck to my hand. And I couldn't move my hand too much, because it would prevent the machine transferring the solution from working properly. So I have to stay in my bed for so many hours.</p><p>And after the treatment, my platelet count quickly went back to normal, and the spots on my body faded away. I still need to regularly have check-ups, which is somewhat annoying. By the way, I only learnt about what my condition is years after I left the hospital. It is called immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakes your platelets as viruses and kills them. I asked and learnt about my condition because I was planning to have blood donations, and gladly I was allowed to donate blood.</p><p>So far, the symptoms of ITP never came back. I feel quite lucky how I remained (mostly) healthy after that, and I actually get to donate my O+ blood. It's still very vague about how ITP happened to me in the first place though...</p></div><p class="date">( 17 Mar 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
