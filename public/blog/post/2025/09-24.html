While cancellation due to bad weather happens sometimes, it is strange it can happen in such a short span of time.</p><p>There's a class that got cancelled due to typhoon this month, then later I heard that another typhoon was coming soon. I was like "Man there sure is a lot of typhoon this month". But typhoon isn't exactly an uncommon thing, and it usually isn't exactly dangerous as soon as you stay indoors during the event. I didn't really check the news about the upcoming typhoon, so I wasn't aware of the strength of the wind.</p><p>Fast forward to two days ago, I was heading to class, and I saw a notice that alerts people what to do during typhoon, which I doesn't see often. The fact people was taking the typhoon more seriously than normal made me realise the typhoon might not be a regular one. I eventually learnt that the typhoon might last a couple days, even my dad called it a super typhoon.</p><p>After school, I went to buy some food for these few days, unfortunately most of the food, especially veggies, were sold out. Fortunately, there are still some instant noodles stocked up, and my sister managed to buy some veggies.</p><p>I also stuck tape onto the windows, in case the window breaks, the tape will hold the pieces together, lessening the damage. Though when I search online, apparently this might be a myth or outdated info:</p><blockquote><h2>Subject: C7) Should I tape my windows when a hurricane threatens?</h2><p>No, it is a waste of effort, time, and tape. It offers little strength to the glass and NO protection against flying debris. After the storm passes you will spend many a hot summer afternoon trying to scrape the old, baked-on tape off your windows (assuming they weren't shattered). Once a Hurricane Warning has been issued you would be better off spending your time putting up shutters over doors and windows. <a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p></blockquote><p>And in a Reddit post:</p><blockquote><p>Taping windows was a measure used prior to the invention of tempered glass and it was actually useful, as you don’t want glass shards flying off like a ninja playing with shurikens.</p><p>But now tempered glass is everywhere so taping it is useless. Due to the completely different physical properties. Taping tempered glass actually lowers its susceptibility to pressure, which means it could break easier than not taped. So, taping tempered glass completely defeats its purpose. <a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p></blockquote><p>However, I'm not exactly sure if the glass in our windows is tempered, also I don't really want to mess with the windows during the typhoon, so I'll let the tape do its job for now.</p><p>Yesterday, though the no.8 typhoon signal is held, outside seems very peaceful, it was so quiet that it felt somewhat eery. Because most of the restaurants were closed, I cooked some instant noodles with eggs and just a few veggies. I looked out to the window, the wind was silent, yet noone was outside, I knew it was the calm before the storm.</p><hr><p>To explain the typhoon signals in Hong Kong:</p><ul><li>No.1: Standby</li><li>No.3: Strong Wind</li><li>No.8: Gale or storm</li><li>No.9: Increasing gale or storm</li><li>No.10: Hurricane</li></ul><p>No.8 signal or above will cancell all classes and work. The one right now, A.K.A. Ragasa, is no.10 right now. Ragasa passed through Philippines a while ago, causing a lot of damages and displacement. People felt quite worried about this hurricane, which reminded me of Typhoon Mangkhut, from 2018, which is 7 years ago... What the fuck you mean it's 7 years ago, I remembered it like yesterday-</p><p>It was a memorable day, the wind was stronger than any I have witnessed. I was safely stuck at home, playing Trophy Run with Squid Ink Cookie. As the strong wind blew towards the building, I could feel my home shaking like there's an earthquake. It was scary, but kinda intriguing. The very next day, the wind had passed, but the damages couls still hurt someone. I was quite shocked that work was not cancelled that day, some people even got injured on their way to work. Like I know HongKongers are hard-working, but still...</p><hr><p>Today, in the early morning, I could hear the whistles from the wind. The force became stronger, and stronger, eventually I got so scared I decided to turn off the air-con (as the typhoon can damage operating air-cons). Mostly, my home is safe. The living room is fine, there was a little bit of leakage in the computer room, but it's not much. My room is fine as well- Oh wait why is there water on the floor?</p><p>As I was chilling in my room, when I went to grab my water, I noticed there's a big water puddle on the floor. It seems the wall is leaking quite a lot of water, the plushie that was on the floor was soaked. I quickly grabbed some towels to cover up the leakage, I was quite shocked by the amount of water.</p><p>I taped a cable on the ceiling, I can use it to check if the building shaking is just an illusion or not. The cable has not been touched for a while, and yet it is moving a little, sometimes not just a little. Yea it's definitely shaking. Not sure if my motion sickness is fucking with me, because I'm actually feeling somewhat nauseous. God damn how do I get things done when my body couldn't lock in?</p><p>Man the day has just started, and it feels there's a lot of damage done. I hope others are safe during this time. Anyways, if anything interesting happens, I will blog again.</p><div class="blogcredit"><h2>Credits/Reference:</h2><ul><li id="1">[1]: <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/C7.html" target="_blank">AOML NOAA: Hurricane Research division</a></li><li id="2">[2]: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1nnf9nr/noaa_says_taping_on_windows_is_useless_and_i/">NOAA says taping on windows is useless and I should use hurricane shutters instead.
