For many years, I dreaded the day I have to go to work. Since I was young, my mom kept complaining that my personality was so awful, I would be scolded at work. But instead of improving myself, I have only grown to be afraid of the concept of working, feeling like stepping into a workplace is the same as being in an abusive environment.</p><p>But lately, it feels my fear of working has slowly subsided. It's either I'm dissociating and disconnected with my emotions, or the briefings my teachers gave us provided me a better idea what the workplace actually is. At least in the current stage my teachers would protect us from unfair treatments.</p><p>Today, we discussed about our CVs. I honestly thought I don't have much I can write into my CV, considering how little extra-curricular activities I attended before. However, with teacher's help, it turns out a lot of the stuff I learnt from my previous courses (especially during last summer term) can be added. My teacher also said language proficiency tests can be included too if the score is good, which is great because I took the IELTS before. When I showed him the score, he praised me that my score is very good, I have 7.5 overall, while Hong Kong students have 6.5 average. I also got 8.5 in reading and 8.0 in listening, just to flex a bit more :3</p><p>Anyways, it feels really good to be praised like that. While I don't know if my CV is very attractive, especially with how much competition is out there, I feel like at least I am suitable to have a job now.</p><p>Before I go back into depressed mode, I should praise myself a bit more. It is quite impressive that I managed to get myself together after secondary school graduation, like I don't consider myself 100% mentally well, but at least I'm not as traumatised as me pre-graduation. While I'm not as hard-working as the top students people always use as role model, I think it is still amazing I managed to find new hobbies, like website coding (apparently I can include HTML and others in my CV, as it is related to my course). I often say that I'm barely holding on to my sanity, but if that's the case, the fact I can thrive on is quite impressive.</p><p>By the way, I have been recreating Good Pizza Great Pizza using my HTML and JavaScript skills, because I don't like how badly customers scold me when I get their orders wrong. I originally posted a blog, but I remembered I don't know how legal it is to share much about a recreation of a game. Anyways, it is a bit difficult to code it, but I'm making progress. When I finish it, I hope I can play it with one hand during train rides.</p><p>This week's classes are all done, I should get some eep now...</p></div><p class="date">( 20 Feb 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
