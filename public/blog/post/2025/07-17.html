Like I said <a href="06-24.html">before</a>, because of my internship, I have significantly less free time than last year, which means I might not be able to do as much attacks as before. As a result, I had set a goal of 44 attacks, which I thought was still a bit too ambitious, and I decided to take this AF lightheartedly.</p><p>Guess what? I already surpassed that goal. Not only that, I am doing attacks in a rate faster than last year.</p><p>In the first few days of AF, I went to Guangzhou for work, there was a lot of tours and stuff. I wanted to draw during train travels and breaks, however I was quite exhausted and did not have much energy to polish my work. I only managed to lock in when I came back home and enjoyed my weekends.</p><p>On a certain day, after I finished work, I really wanted to do an attack, but I was outside and didn't have much energy. So I wanted to draw something less energy intensive, which is chibi head portraits. Back when I drew the AF cover, it was also done on mobile, and I found it quite relaxing to draw when it was just chibi. And I was like "Hm maybe I should try attacking in chibi style." After doing one chibi attack, I realised how fun it is to draw on mobile (except for the fact Medibang spams you with ads if you don't turn off mobile data/wifi). That point on, I attacked mostly in chibi style, and occasionally full body drawings if I came back home and still got energy.</p><p>While I love drawing traditionally, I think I discovered how mobile phone drawing can be fun too. For one, cleaning the line art in mobile is quite fun, I currently using the mapping pen brush. Because pen pressure doesn't really work if you are just using your fingers, I have to refine the edges by erasing the tips. For some reason, I found it relaxing more than annoying. I also learnt to enjoy highlights, which I used to not enjoy because I rarely remember to draw them. It feels far easier to draw the highlights in mobile (because white ink sometimes gets blended with colored pencils), and I love how shiny and tasty the hair looks with the highlights. The most satisfying part is probably enhancing the lineart colors using airbrush, it really brings out the whole drawing!</p><p>Although chibi art is less energy intensive than my regular ones, I wouldn't say I put less effort. I mean it's really difficult to finish the drawings in between my bathroom breaks, I still don't know how to take breaks in the office without looking like I'm slacking off. Anyways in each of my attacks, I always try my best to make them look great, so I really hope the OC's owners would enjoy them :'3</p><p>If I continue the rate of around 3 attacks per day, I might even surpass my old record of 74 attacks, but I shouldn't put too much pressure onto myself. I should rest a bit and draw some muscular women, or men idk.</p><p class="date">( 17 Jul 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
