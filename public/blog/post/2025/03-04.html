I don't know how it would affect the RSS system, so if your notifications got spammed, I'm so sorry :(</p><p>I was an Ipad kid, I spent a lot of time playing random games. And as the years passed, many games faded from the App Store, as the developers stopped updating them. There's a lot of games I still remember though, it would be nice to play them again, though I don't think it would be possible...</p><p>While the games doesn't show up in App Store anymore, it is easier to find them using "before: [date]" in Google, it filters out anything after said date. I just searched games before 2010, it's over a decade, but I'm certain most of my child games are before that period. And hey, I have gotten some results!</p><p>Majority of these games aren't availible anymore, so I just review them based off my nostalgia-coated memories, I don't think I'd enjoy them very much if I play them today.</p><h2>Spellcraft: School of Magic</h2><p>One of my favourite childhood games. As the title suggests, it is a game about magic, and you can brew magic spells as cards, kill monsters in dungeons, plant stuff and keep pets (familiars I think). Child me isn't very bright, it did take me a while to understand the attack system, but each card (spell) has different functions, and there are some cards that are only useful to certain enemies (like there are cards targeting rats).</p><p>It is quite fun trying to figure out the system, and what excited me the most about this game was the pet system, I mean who doesn't like pets? Sadly, I had to delete the game because everytime I opened the game, it just freezes, and I didn't have anything to fix it.</p><center><h2>Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…</h2></center><h2>Flying hamster</h2><p>Oh hey! A game that is still availible on App Store! This is a game where you control a flying hamster fighting against giant creatures. To summarise the premise, the protag and a girl hamster were playing on the beach, when they found a golden sunflower seed. However, the girl hamster got captured quickly after that, so the protagonist rushes to rescue. And everytime they nearly reunited after each boss fight, she always gets captured again by the next boss Spoilers for the ending: <span class="spoiler">When the two hamsters finally reunited, it turns out the protagonist isn't trying to save his lover, but the golden sunflower seed. As the protag happily enjoys the tasty golden seed, the girl hamster angrily gives him a jump kick. Funny game lmao</span></p><p>Despite how charming the art and story is, the game is incredibly difficult. If you want to beat the game, you have to beat each level consecutively. If you die, you have to start again. You can imagine how tough it was for me, my clumsy little fingers wasn't very good at moving very well. Somehow, I think I beat the game at least once, I mean what other reason can it be that I have the memory of the ending?</p><center><h2>Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†</h2></center><h2>Pocket God</h2><p>Another game that is still availible. I didn't have much fond memories for this one, I didn't like gore very much as a kid, and the game is all about killing little characters in many ways. I got freaked out and deleted the game when I got the chance (my sister played the game I think).</p><center><h2>Rating: â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†</h2></center><h2>Cat Flight (Placeholder name until I find the actual name I SWEAR it's called this)</h2><p>The gameplay is simple, you throw the paper plane as far as you can, there are also boosts than can help you fly further. The story is quite sweet as well, the protagonist was trying to find a herb to save another cat who's sick, so it's travelling afar using the paper plane. Spoilers for the ending: <span class="spoiler">Fortunately, the story ends happily, with the cat finding the herb and the sick cat is healed.</span></p><p>As I'm searching, I found a game that is extremely similar to the game I'm talking about , it's just called "Flight!", so if I never find the actual name, you can just look up that game to understand the gameplay.</p><center><h2>Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</h2></center><h2>Alley Cat</h2><p>I'm surprised to know that it was based off a game for Atari, damn it's old. Anyways, the version I played isn't in pixelart, but detailed drawn assets. The reason I remember that game so much because the humans HATE the cat so much for some reason, they kept throwing stuff at the poor cat :( , though I think the goal of the game is to mess with the humans now that I look it up. The part I remember the most is when the cat enters a fish bowl, you have to eat all the fish before the cat drowns. And you just, slowly watch its lungs fill up with water, kinda disturbing.</p><center><h2>Rating: â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†</h2></center><h2>Pet World: My Animal Shelter</h2><p>This is a game where you keep different animals and take care of them until they are adopted. I had a lot of fun taking care of the animals, I enjoy repetitive stuff a lot ngl. This game is still availible in App Store. However, I saw its new icon, and it is suspiciously AI-like, and upon closer inspection, the dog's mouth is very weird, yep it's definitely AI. My goat is washed ðŸ’”</p><center><h2>Rating: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</h2></center><hr><p>There is one more game I want to mention, but it isn't my childhood game, it is my sister's. She mentioned that there is a detective game that she used to play on the Ipad. The protagonist is a blue dog, and... Yea that's all the hint that she had, she played this game as a little kid after all. What's confirmed is that it isn't related to any games from Sam & Max. So if you have any ideas what the game might be (or if you simply have a childhood game to share), please comment down below.</p><p class="date">( 4 Mar 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
