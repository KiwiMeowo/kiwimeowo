I didn't really open the website since I assumed it will be like r/place and take forever to place one pixel, but as it turns out, Wplace is a little bit easier to draw. Instead of only 1 pixel per 5 minutes, it's 1 pixel per 30 seconds, and there is a cooldown bar that stores the accumulated pixels (at least up to 60 I think), and you can upgrade the limit by points. And instead of a plain canvas, you draw on the map of the Earth, you can even draw in your home town if you want to.</p><p>After knowing it exists, I decided to take part in it as well. I drew Cosmos and Lavender, Timekeeper, Pome and more. But honestly, I don't think the best experience is just my drawings, but other people'e drawings as well.</p><p>Through out the map in Hong Kong, there are plenty of Deltarune art, and many other fandam art as well (but Deltarune is the most common). While I know Deltarune is popular, I did not think so many people would draw them, there are even meme references that I wouldn't think Hong Kongers would know about. Also what the fuck there's even homestuck references here.</p><p>The thing that brings me most joy is the amount of pride flags in Hong Kong. I always thought that Hong Kong, or Chinese-speaking communities in general, are somewhat conservative, especially towards trans people (I saw quite a bit of posts against trans and non-binary people among Chinese-speaking communities). Maybe they won't lash out directly to LGBT people, but they might not treat them very kindly. In Wplace, I saw a surprising amount of pride flags through out the Hong Kong map, even the trans flag. At first I was a little bit unsure if these are actually made by Hong Kongers, "Like maybe some westerners came to Hong Kong for some reason and drew them" I thought. However, I saw there's a quote written on the map "Any üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è HKers?" And there are plenty of greetings made by others. I'm not trans, but I feel so happy that LGBT people in Hong Kong managed to find a safe space in a digital version of Hong Kong.</p><p>To some degree, I unironically think Hong Kong people only cares about meaningful things like work and studying (probably since I was in a school who cared a lot about grades). When I grow a little older and expanded my social circle, I still fail to find people who have the same interests as me. I'm somewhat afraid that my ideas and interests would not accepted by anyone here, staying in online spaces managed to find me some good friends, but am I really alone here in Hong Kong?</p><p>But after partaking in events like expos, I have been proven wrong again and again. There are plenty of HKers who love Cookie Run and Blue Lock, there are plenty of HKers who likes nerdy stuff, there are plenty of HKers who are queer. As a person who is afraid of sharing my interests and coming out as a demisexual in fear of being ridiculed, it brings me so much courage and joy.</p><p>One complaint I have about Wplace is the server issues, it sometimes breaks and we can't get in. But that's what happens when thousands of people play this online game. Anyways, you can try to find my doodles if you want, Hong Kong isn't very big after all!</p><p class="date">( 9 Aug 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
