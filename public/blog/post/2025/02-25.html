They kept saying how free their education is, contrary to how strict and uncaring parents and teachers are here. They said how the teachers let children learn through fun, outdoor actvities instead of just reading books in class, and they let kids enjoy their hobbies, learn at their own pace, climb trees...</p><p>While Hong Kong people's way of education can be flawed (it is always sad students get depressed from all the high expectations), I'm not sure how true those claims are, it sounds like one of those people who's stuck in "grass is greener on the other side". One thing that got stuck in my mind though, is that they get to climb trees.</p><p>One of my ideas of non East Asia kids when I was younger is that they have more freedom to do wild stuff, and climbing trees. In Hong Kong, or at least in my experience, adults don't really let kids something as dangerous as climbing trees (I still remember the time my PE teacher didn't let my class play dodgeball cuz it is too dangerous or whatever, man it was my favourite ball sports D&#58;&lt;). Whenever people talk about kids from other countries, a picture of them climbing trees is often accompanied. As someone who never got to climb trees, I was quite jealous.</p><p>While I like the concept of climbing trees, I really don't think I can actually climb one. I'm not the physically strong type, I run out of energy quite quickly, the only thing that might be advantageous is my above-average height. I bet if I'm given the opportunity to climb one, I'd probably fall and break a bone. Actually, I don't think I have broken a bone in my life, as of right now.</p><p>Speaking of breaking a bone, I once heard an article about how parents from western countries allow their kids to fail or get injured, because their kids get to gain experience. A parent got interviewed, about how their kid broke their leg after falling from a tree. However, the parents didn't react badly about the injure, and after the kid recovered, they didn't stop the kid from climbing it. While I don't know if all parents from western countries are as calm as these parents, I found it quite funny their kid broke a bone and they are like "Oh ok", unlike most parents I heard who would panic a lot.</p><p>Thinking about all the tree's I've seen, most of them are too tall and old to climb. And if I dare to climb one, the passerbys might become concerned and call the police. Although there are many things that are way safer to climb (I've been to a playground in Shen Zhen, and there is a climbing facility, with proper equipment of course), climbing a tree has always been at the back of my mind. I wonder if I get to climb a tree one day...</p></div><p class="date">( 25 Feb 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../../e.js"></script><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
