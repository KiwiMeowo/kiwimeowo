So after being back in my room, I opened Minecraft and started building. Midway through, I felt somewhat nauseous, but I just assumed it was due to my coffee (caffeine makes me sick sometimes) and the cold weather. And at some point, the sickness became unbearable. I decided to take a break, and only then I remembered: I get motion sickness from Minecraft.</p><p>It wasn't always a thing in my early days of playing Minecraft. In fact, I could play hours of Minecraft without feeling awful years ago! After a few years of dropping Minecraft, a friend invited me to a server to play. But after setting my base and building my house, I felt unusually awful. I continued on, but the feeling got worse, and I threw up into the toilet.</p><p>My friend told me that it was motion sickness. I looked up online, and apparently it is a thing that can happen in first person perspective games. It is caused by your view not matching your other senses, causing a confusion in your brain. But it's so strange, because it didn't happen back then, why now?</p><p>Something slightly relevant is that I get motion sickness in cars as well. When I'm in very bumpy car rides, or if the car smells bad, I will get horribly sick. Reading or watching videos only makes the feeling worse, the only entertainment I have is watching the view outside (which is something I like :3). And if I feel sick, I have to go nap, which is the best solution if the car can't be stopped, or else I will actually throw up. Perhaps my inner ear is more sensitive, but if that's the case, why didn't I get sick playing Minecraft when I was young?</p><p>This is quite sad when you think of it. Minecraft was my favourite game, and even though I have outgrown it, I still enjoy coming back to this game and build something cool once in a while. But when I get sick playing this game, it would be so hard to keep on enjoying the game, even though it allows me to express myself in ways other that drawing.</p><p>I still haven't found a solution to this problem, changing the FOV doesn't do much, neither does disabling bobbing, and I often play in window mode. If you guys have any tricks, it would be wonderful if you can share them!</p></div><p class="date">( 22 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
