In my Youtube recommendations, I saw a clip of RtC, compiling the funny moments of the musical. I really like the humor from the clips I saw, "As there's nothing more based than death, Vergil shall play, the bass" (Insert rat playing the bass). Luckily, the recommendations also showed me the musical...'s slime tutorial. Mm yeah, it is just a normal slime tutorial.</p><p>I'm not the type of people with high patience. I have an anxiety of possibly watching a media which contains triggering media, but it isn't that bad anymore. However, I still don't like spending too much time on media which might be not very interesting. My idea is that if the media I'm watching doesn't interest me after 3 episodes or a quarter of the video, depending on the format, I would just drop it. While some people might find preservering until the show gets good is a better practice, I believe that making the audience engaged is one of the key things to a good story, and failing to interest me probably means it isn't for me. There has been media which received good feedback that I tried but I couldn't get into it, like what's interesting about a broken family whining about how broken their family is for 30 minutes straight?</p><p>Fuck I digressed. What I'm trying to say is RtC quickly got me engaged very quickly. Something about its humor is what I really enjoy, and yet there are moments that feel more serious and touching.</p><hr><p>RtC is about a group of teenagers in Uranium City who died in a rollercoaster accident, but a machine (Karnak) which can predict people's death felt bad for their demise and decided to bring one of them back to life. Each teenagers will perform a song that represents themselves, and that would determine who comes back to life, probably.</p><p>The teenagers consists of 6 people, Ocean (Who tries so hard to make herself look good, it makes her more arrogant), Noel (The only gay boy in the town who wishes to be a harlet in post war France), Misha (A Ukranian boy who misses his home country and wants to meet his online girlfriend), Ricky (A disabled boy who can't speak or walk without crutches during his lifetime, but daydreams about saving the world by... making love with cat women), Jane Doe (Whose real identity is unknown as her head went missing after the accident), and Constance (A girl who's ashamed about being fine staying in this small town).</p><p>I don't really want to explain everything in the musical, so I will just point out the parts I remember the most.</p><p>I was a little bit distracted during the transition from Ocean to Noel, but when my gaze went back to the screen, I just saw Noel in a wig and dress, making out with Misha. I feel like among all of the songs in RtC, I found Noel's Lament to be the catchiest, I don't know if I want to play this song without headphones though owo;.</p><p>Misha was adopted by parents who hate him (because they got scammed after getting a forged birth certificate), and also after losing his mother, he grew to resent this town. He also found a girlfriend online, who is also from Ukrane. In his second part of his song, the song and the dance is based of Ukranian tradition, it feels like not just a love song for his girlfriend, but also longing for his home country. While the previous songs are a bit more light-hearted, this part was a bit more somber, knowing Misha would not ever meet his love, if his lover is even real that is.</p><p>Ricky was unable to talk due to his disability, but in the afterlife, he is able to walk and talk normally. However, in one part, when the teenagers happened to stumble upon the topic of porn somehow, Ricky says that porn is beautiful and magical, which shocked Ocean quite a lot. Despite him being referred as sweet little Ricky Potts, he actually daydreams a lot about being freaky with alien cat women. Despite the strange theme, he sings a lot about how people should not make hate, but make love (lol). He is the only one who actually concedes, why is the character with strangest song in the musical lowkey so cool.</p><p>Constance's part was perhaps the saddest one in my opinion. She was regarded as the nicest girl in town, and is generally a people pleaser. Like despite Ocean saying mean things about her, she somehow tolerated that. Constance hated how she is known as the girl who is kind and fine about being in this town. And among the other teens, who lamented they died as virgins, she is the only one who lost her virginity right before she rode the Cyclone. Despite that, she is not happy, she simply did that due to low self-esteem.</p><p>But when she rode the Cyclone, instead of being terrified, her memories of her life flooded her brain, she remembered all the happy things and the reasons why she loves this town. Her song is the only one where the other teens got to be themselves instead of playing for a role, and they all celebrated how wonderful life is. Recently, I watched a video which is in the POV of a person who committed suicide, and realised how beautiful life is and how much her family misses her, but it is too late to go back. The song seems to have a similar feeling, she sings about the joy of her life, but there is a sorrow that she couldn't celebrate it when she's still alive.</p><hr><p>I startedd the musical thinking it's just a silly story, but it ended with something emotional and memorable. The musical managed to have jokes that are funny and not overdone, and also blend in some serious moments that aren't monotonous.</p><p>This musical has a lot of great quotes, aside from the bass one:</p><ul><li>"They were the only choir in the competition.""This just shows the high standards of excellence in Kiwanis – even in competition against yourself, you can still walk away a loser. "</li><li>"Please turn off your cellphones. I can assure you none of the calls you are about to receive will have life-altering consequences... except for one of you."</li><li>"Mine will only have profanity in the chorus" (Misha's songs does not have profanity in the chorus)</li><li>"You wouldn’t have called every one of your potential judges a loser, crowing about your superiority in song, culminating in you standing on top of them in a human pyramid? That did strike me as an unorthodox strategy"</li></ul><p>If I had to be honest, this musical also made me realise I could've made Solar a bit less likeable. At first, she's just a leader type character who's brave and charming, but I finally remembered the arrogant part which I forgot to add.</p><p>God this blog is longer than I intended.</p><p class="date">( 19 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
