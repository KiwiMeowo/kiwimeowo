I'm pretty sure it's dissociation, I'm not so sure on it's definition, but the fact I feel very numb probably means it's dissociation.</p><p>Dissociation means detachment from self or reality from what I've gathered, though I always felt the definitions are very vague. When I was growing up, there's always a cloud in my brain, and I always felt like I'm always running on auto-pilot. I wouldn't call that experience "feeling like my mind is outside my body", but I felt like my mind isn't very clear. Thanks to counselling, I felt better about myself, and the fog cleared up.</p><p>Still, I still suffer from varying degrees of dissociation. Sometimes, my brain would feel like there's a fog again. And maybe I would space out more than usual, unable to keep myself in reality. And recently, especially today, the symptoms of dissociation is so bad.</p><p>This blog is probably for venting and maybe mark down the symptoms for future use</p><ul><li>My brain feels very foggy and groggy</li><li>My mood: Nothing</li><li>I want to feel something, but I don't know my mind and soul is intact</li><li>This is kinda dreadful, if I have to describe this state</li><li>Like I feel like I should feel something, but I just [blank]</li><li>Why am I feeling numb and painful at the same time</li></ul><p>I think it is mostly caused by internship stuff, while I was quite glad I have a chance to get a job, the stress of preparing for it might be too much for me to handle, even though I thought I can. It isn't the first time I had an interview, and I certainly didn't do too bad. But school gets stressful sometimes maybe, so now I'm sitting here, trying to process this sense of nothingness. I wish I could be more productive this weekend, with all the work I need to do, but all I've been doing is just sitting and spacing out.</p><p>It's a bit frustrating, but I heard journaling is supposed to help? I don't know if it makes me feel better after venting, but I really enjoy how it feeling typing on the keyboard. The clicky noises is very soothing.</p></div><p class="date">( 5 Apr 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
