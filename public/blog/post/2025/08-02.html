Like last year, I'm going to end the season by writing a cool conclusion. And first, the results!</p><h2>Overall Battle Stats</h2><div class="progress"><div class="progress-bar" style="width:68.23%;background-color:#8e9995">68.23%</div></div><ul><li>Points: 9006.5</li><li>Attacks: 92</li><li>Friendly Fire: 112</li><li>Defenses: 95</li></ul><h2>Current Battle Stats</h2><div class="progress"><div class="progress-bar" style="width:68.29%">68.29%</div></div><ul><li>Points: 5633.75</li><li>Attacks: 43</li><li>Friendly Fire: 69</li><li>Defenses: 52</li></ul><p>It's funny how I said I might not be able to do as much attacks as before before AF started, but look, <u>112</u> attacks! How did I even get here, so let's go back from the beginning!</p><hr><p>This summer term, I have to attend an internship, but the fact it occupies all of July means I wouldn't be able to spend as much time on AF. I set a goal of 44 attacks ("two small sketches during weekdays, and one probably higher quality drawing during weekends").</p><p>For the first few days of AF, I travelled to Guangzhou. I woke up at 5 to work on one attack, then did a few attacks using just pen and colored pencils, However, I'm not very proud of the pieces, they didn't come out as great as I wanted.</p><h2>First attack</h2><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bs70e0d5uudzizlhfktwx/1.jpg?rlkey=2t87uk3rndlqbckgq5m8ln9a7&raw=1"><center><a href="https://artfight.net/attack/8846862.cam" target="_blank">For realityiswack: Cam</a></center><p>After I came back to Hong Kong, I did a bunch of alcohol marker drawings, as per usual. On July 8, I did something different. When I was leaving from work, I felt extremely bored and really wanted to draw. While I am usually bad at drawing on mobile phone, I remembered I also drew the chibis in the AF cover on my phone. So I tried to do a simple attack...</p><h2>The flood gates had opened</h2><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9rqdqafhntkhhetvwhlty/16.jpg?rlkey=u6qt8n3yazdl0pk3rv1a3zgm0&raw=1"><center><a href="https://artfight.net/attack/10385136.azure" target="_blank">For Kinokiita: Azure</a></center><p>After realising how simple and fun it is to draw chibis on phone, I decided to start drawing chibis during work breaks or in transportations. With this strategy, I can do 2-4 attacks per weekday.</p><h2>Ouhhh kbity making biscuits</h2><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/txcuvj7bsswr2y70pazgy/91.jpg?rlkey=8bifp1ja5sgtsdb8e1zwuf64w&raw=1"><center><a href="https://artfight.net/attack/12367968.rye" target="_blank">For SaltyBirb: Rye</a></center><p>Aside from chibis, I also learnt some efficient techniques of drawing traditional attacks. With my alcohol markers getting old and used up, some of them, particularly the light colored ones, are drying up. While I have a newer set of alcohol markers, I feel like I should save the colors as much as I can. And surprisingly, oil pastels can work quite well for background, even if they can be a bit messy to work with.</p><h2>Ouhhh kbity making biscuits</h2><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/g9sbg4e0nqr7rpblpe52t/84.jpg?rlkey=6o11q2s3q6g5z91s7ffolj2dg&raw=1"><center><a href="https://artfight.net/attack/12285925.star" target="_blank">For Phiri-art: Star</a></center><p>A little funny event, mid-AF, I added a new character, <a href="https://artfight.net/character/7811372.kaylee-evil-kyrea" target="_blank">Kaylee</a>. I have been planning this concept for a while, but I decided to add her now cuz I wanted to take a break from drawing attacks by drawing OC sheets, apparently. I felt like Kyrea is the type to fantisize having a evil clone (because I drew evil Kyrea when I was a kid), but what if characters opposite to the original world came to my OC world, and Kyrea is greeted her opposite clone, and instead of cool and evil, she is sad and hates cringe? Her character is based off my "anti-Mary Sue" phase, where I made Kyrea bland and normal looking to make her an "interesting and realistic" character. Now that I have grown up, being realistic does not equate a interesting character, we all need whimsy in our lives.</p><p>Anyways, I uploaded the character to AF, and went to sleep. The next day, I was surprised to see that I was greeted by 4 ATTACKS, AND ALL OF THEM ARE FOR KAYLEE. Apparently, AF's new discovery system shows newly characters, and perhaps many people found her this way. I was fucking terrified lmao.</p><hr><p>Despite the majority of my attacks being chibis, my favourite ones are always the traditional ones.</p><h2>Andy and their ideal self</h2><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pcbssl00xh5ea2fmqkipf/49.jpg?rlkey=5vvakksau5wz2sn4izz2w56yh&raw=1"><center><a href="https://artfight.net/attack/12285925.star" target="_blank">For Meuikii: Andy</a></center><p>I was feeling particularly inspired after reading Andy's bio, and I think a drawing of Andy looking into the mirror and seeing their magical form would be so cool. It took a bit of work, and it came out fantastic!</p><h2>Warm colored forest</h2><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/czhzoqv6hg3j38ifjb24l/57.jpg?rlkey=jdslkqyihymenc2gm7uionfwy&raw=1"><center><a href="https://artfight.net/attack/11645248.begonia" target="_blank">For charrxcoal: begonia</a></center><p>The character's design is somewhat complex, but I really love the color scheme. I feel like it would look very great if I drew them in a autumny forest, and as I was working on the drawing, I got surprised how amazing the colors came together. This is probably my favourite attack of this year!</p><h2>Honorable mention: The aurafarming</h2><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/l2q3a8lh7p8og69jt1cnn/104.jpg?rlkey=2uilkf064v0s7lz5cxhrcniyf&raw=1"><center><a href="https://artfight.net/attack/12677042.aura-farming" target="_blank">For realityiswack: The The Amaranths</a></center><p>Having attacked realityiswack many times and got attacked by them many times, I decided to attack them one more time.I always think the Deltarune art of Susie, Ralsei and Kris standing in front of the light pillar is cool as hell, and I feel like drawing the Amaranths this way would look very cool as well. However, I struggled a bit drawing this, I wanted to do this on my laptop at first, but I realised I'm not very good at sketching on digital. Later, I drew this using alcohol markers, then refined it using CSP. It looks nice, but it's a bit rough since I'm not good at drawing backs and background like this. I should practise digital art more...</p><hr><p>112 attacks... It is an insane number that I wouldn't challenge before this year. The chibi strat is really good, it doesn't burn me out at all, and I am actually struggling to find new characters to draw! Maybe I should do it again next year if I have little time to draw. I'm not sure if I will break this record next year, I would assume if I do more full drawings, the attack number will actually go down since I put more time on each attacks.</p><p class="date">( 2 Aug 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
