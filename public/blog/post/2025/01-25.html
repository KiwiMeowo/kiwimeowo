In fact, I think this is fastest I have flown in my dreams.</p><p>In this dream, I played as someone else. In this world, the Solar System is dying, the planets and moons were merging together, and the sun was going to go supernova. However, there are some humans that gained wings, and they have a chance to leave the planet and survive somewhere else (humans don't die in space somehow), and I (or the character I was playing) was one of them.</p><p>The human civilisation watched the planets crashed into one another, I'm pretty sure Eris was one of the dwarf planets shown in my dream. The Earth was not touched by any planets, instead, the Sun went supernova, the explosion englufing everything that comes into it.</p><p>I quickly grabbed my mom and sister (not the ones I have irl) and flew away from Earth as fast as possible. I flew as fast as I could, at a speed I never thought possible, not gonna lie it felt good flying like that. However, it is very difficult to outrun the explosion of the sun, especially with two people in my arms.</p><p>Realising we might not survive this, I said my final goodbye "If we can’t survive this, I just want to say, I love you". But they replied "No, you will survive". They loosened their grip on my arms, falling into the expanding sun. I watched their bodies shatter into a million pieces as they fall into the shining sea of flames. It was a devastating scene.</p><p>Me and the surviving humans found a habitable planet and rebuilt a civilisation. For some reason, my character now hallucinates the mother and sister sometimes.</p><hr><h2>Rating</h2><ul><li>Entertainment: 10/10</li><li>Senses: 10/10</li><li>Story: 8/10 (The story is wonderful but a bit short)</li></ul><p>What's interesting about this dream is not only the story, but also I learnt that there is a planetary alignment event on Jan 25, idk if it's today or tomorrow, timezones are funky. Does the merging planets in my dream referring to the planets being in line? Does that mean space can affect my dreams? Huh, maybe this theory can be an inspiration for my worldbuilding...</p></div><p class="date">( 25 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
