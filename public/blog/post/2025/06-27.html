But one interesting thing about myself is that I sometimes enjoy taking pictures of birds on the street.</p><p>In Hong Kong, or at least the area I live, the most common birds I see are sparrows and pigeons. These birds are very common, and people usually pay no mind to these birds (unless if they are living on the air cons).</p><p>However, I have a friend who is quite fond of birds, and maybe because of that, I started to notice birds more. Moreover, I always had a habit of taking photos of interesting things I see, including flowers, pretty views, somthing like that. And eventually, birds became one of the things I would take pictures of.</p><p>I usually take pictures of round birbs, some birds look especially orbular, chonky even. Or sometimes when a bird is very close to me, I will often take the opportunity to take a pic before it flies away. Birds are often quite scaredy, when a human gets too close to them or stares at them for too long, usually they fly away. So when they unintentionally get into my camera zone, I would hurry to get my phone out, sadly they usually notice and flee before I can get a good pic.</p><p>I am no bird expert, and I don&rsquo;t know all the bird species in Hong Kong yet. However, I do find birds that are not pigeons or sparrows quite cool. I like taking pictures of birds I don&rsquo;t often notice, even though I have less opportunity to take a pic of them. And actually I managed to learn about a bird species, which is the red-whiskered bulbul. I usually see them hanging out on trees or bushes, so it can be difficult to get a clear picture of them. However in a morning, I saw a bulbul just chilling on a wall, and VERY close to me. And very luckily, I got a decently clear picture of it, and I got a pic again in another day!</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/p0pmwfvrk5p46qcjmv8l8/IMG_4064_20250627.jpg?rlkey=ka2td3f1gsg7nfnhqhgpa0m81&raw=1"> <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kld6zwf7q1320hsnuf79k/IMG_4099_20250627.JPG?rlkey=q4akgjn99f1ksr6pf5q78wiml&raw=1"><center>I wonder if they are the same bird</center><p>The bird photos may have occupied some amount of space in my photo storage, but yea I like them.</p><p class="date">( 27 Jun 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
