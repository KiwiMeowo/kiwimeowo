However, Youtube recommends me the trailers sometimes, allowing me to check out the news sometimes.</p><p>Just now, I got recommended <a href="https://youtu.be/Ej7mGFLVcOA?si=KOEKKkUjAslLFhBx" target="_blank">Rin Penrose's reaction to the newest Direct</a>. Like expected, Rin Penrose was quite pleased at the announcement of Tomodachi Life's release season. I was eating my dinner peacefully, while the Vtuber reacts with excitement and shock.</p><p>Later, there is a trailer that shows a beach with the title "A Killer Return to Paradise". "Holy shit, it's Danganronpa 2" Rin Penrose exclaimed. Well it's definitely not Danganronpa 2, I'm pretty sure Kodaka was done with Danganronpa already. Imagine my shock when NAGITO FUCKING KOMAEDA SHOWED ON SCREEN???? I choked on my food so hard- BRO WHY ARE YOU ON SWITCH 2????</p><p>At first, I was confused: Why did DR2 get a remake, but not DR1? Apparently, not only DR2 got a remake, there is also a new storyline, Danganronpa 2x2. Something altered in the story, now there's new murderers, new victims, oh my god NEW DANGANRONPA LORE!!!!!! What's the most interesting thing is that perhaps just like v2, which means 53, the 2x2 also means something special: 4. There's a new Danganronpa sequel holy fuck.</p><p>Back in 2016, I became a fan of Danganronpa. I was intrigued by the funny fan content, and I also love killing games. When DRV3 first released, I was so hyped every night, and I would stay up very late to watch the victims and culprits unfold without spoilers, even if there is an exam tomorrow. But after the years past, I lost interest in Danganronpa, and I wasn't particularly interested in Kodaka's other games (the stories are kinda boring, though the twists are very cool).</p><p>And like I mentioned above, I wasn't expecting Danganronpa to get new content, especially not a sequel. Considering how v3 ended, it felt like Kodaka is telling us to move on and let the games end. A controversial ending indeed, but it left a <span class="secret" title="Honse">deep impact</span> in my heart, maybe even inspired how I write my OCs.</p><p>While I said it's a sequel, but maybe it's more of an alternate route more. Due to some Danganronpa lore I will not be explaining, <span class="secret" title="who tells your story">who lives who dies</span> does not matter in Danganronpa 2, so it should not impact the overall story structure much. But when that's the case, I'm quite curious how the story will develop, would it be as impactful as how we experienced the original DR2?</p><p>Anyways, I'm quite excited about this new game, and maybe I will actually play this game this time instead of watching a playthrough. I am an adult and I have control over my money.</p><p class="date">( 13 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
