They are often used to link to sites, or just decoration purposes. They are usually small in size, so that it doesn't use up too much storage or load too long in websites.</p><p>When I was collecting buttons, badges, other stuff, I feel a strange sense of familiarity. "Have I done something like this before?" I asked, the answer is yes.</p><hr><h2>Flashback to years ago...</h2><p>I was very fascinated with collecting stickers ever since I was a child. I think this hobby of mine started when I saw my sisters collecting My Melody soft stickers, the stickers fit my criteria of fixiation:</p><ol><li>They are small (I like miniature stuff)</li><li>They are soft and fun to touch</li><li>Cute characters</li></ol><p>After seeing the stickers, I decided to start collecting stickers as well, well honestly young me enjoys copying my sister a lot. I asked my parents to buy me a sticker book, and I started putting stickers that I get in it. I wouldn't say it is a very good idea to put these stickers in those kind of books, the books don't protect the stickers very well. And when you try to take them out, the stickers will peel off a layer from the page, making both the sticker and book damaged.</p><p>Anyways back to memory flashbacks, a little fun fact about me is that I was in scouts in the past (might talk about this in the future). One of the badges is related to collecting stuff, and because I happened to collect stickers, I brought my sticker books. Some of my peers weren't very respectful though, they took out some of my stickers and laughed at how there are stickers of girls in underwear. The leader reprimanded them, and gifted me a new sticker if I remember it correctly...</p><h2>Wait what's about girls in underwear?</h2><p>Oh yea, there's a type of stickers that acts like dressup games. On a certain Christmas, I received a Christmas letter with two stickers, it was a bunny with a heart sticker on top of it (or smth like that, I lost the letter ): ). I was extremely amazed by the sticker, like a sticker on top of ANOTHER sticker? Unbelieveable!</p><p>Shortly after that, I learnt about a type of stickers that you put on top of another sticker. So there's stickers that you can play dress up with, there will be girls without clothing as stickers, and by their side there will be clothings you can put on the girls. One thing about me is that I love the concept of dress up as well (though I am too lazy to make up and look good), so these type of stickers scratch my brain so good.</p><p>As the years past, my obsession with stickers slowly faded, because with me drawing less Christmas cards, the need for stickers decreased a lot. I still occassionally buy them if they are REALLY cute, like hamster stickers.</p><hr><p>Collecting real stickers feels similar to collecting website buttons/stickers/badges, like how do I not love tiny little guys? Though I must say I am a bit pickier collecting virtual ones, I tend to like the ones that are less shiny, and I prefer allocating a smaller space for decorational images. But maybe I should make more of those myself, that sounds fun!</p></div><p class="date">( 1 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
