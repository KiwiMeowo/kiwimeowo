While I didn't go hardcore like I did with Cookie Run, I open the game somewhat frequently during day offs. It's actually quite satisfying to train the characters, my favourite mode is the U.A.F., it can train multiple stats at once, and all of the horses I train there have really good stats.</p><p>I always try to read each of the character's stories, though I get kinda tired from reading so many words. Some of the stories are quite cute, but it's easy to lose focus and just skim through the text quickly. I'm sorry horse girls but I have low attention span when it comes to reading.</p><p>So last night, I decided that I wanted to train a character before sleep. I wanted to train a character who is good at short distances, and recently I pulled Rhein Kraft from her gacha banner, so I decided to train her this time.</p><p>Rhein Kraft is a bright and cheerful girl who loves the sun and has a great dream of winning the Triple Tiara. Though she had a change of plans after learning she is better at short distances, her new goal was to win the races that others thought are impossible. Because of her passion, those around her were influenced by her dreams, and wanted to achieve something greater as well, even the horse girls from the older generations were affected by her ambitions.</p><p>However, she has been dreaming a lot lately. In her dreams, she has been seeing the future of the horse girls, raising their next generation. And while she was dreaming, her peers and the trainer (us) are noticing that she has been sleeping longer than normal, and harder to wake up. She is taken to the hospital for a body check, but nothing out of the ordinary is found.</p><p>After the summer training, she fell into her dreams again in the trainer's room. This time, she finally meets her future self, but unlike others, she does not have a future generation to raise, it's just her, and her alone.</p><p>She was carried back to her dorm, her roommate waits for her to wake up to eat dinner, or maybe a midnight snack... But she never woke up. She slept for so long, her roommate realizes the severity of her condition. She was sent to the hospital, the doctor couldn't figure out what's wrong, but somehow she's so deep in her sleep, she's not waking for days. Her face is calm and peaceful, it's like she's simply taking a nap and will wake up soon, and yet she still haven't woken up...</p><p>In Rhein Kraft's dreams, her dream self says that unlike the other horse girls, she will leave this world without a legacy, without a trace. Her dream of leaving behind something great to the world will be left ungranted. With her falling into a coma, and her dream saying she did not leave behind a legacy, it is obvious that her real life counterpart suffered a tragic fate. In fact, the real life Rhein Kraft passed away due to acute heart failure at the young age of 4.</p><p>Rhein Kraft was quite saddened, but... "I didn't leave anything behind? Not even a trace? ...Then why does my hand feel so warm?" Her friends, her rivals, they gathered together in the hospital room, and held her hand, hoping it will remind her of the joy when she raced against them. Even if she died before she achieved higher goals or produced offspring, she didn't leave the world without impact, the short moments that she raced on this earth has impacted people.</p><p>While real life is often cruel, the point of Pretty Derby is to immortalize the race horses in a form of a new story, sharing their life to people who might not be familiar with horse racing. In the world of Pretty Derby, she finally wakes up, greeted by the trainer and friends who loves her very much...</p><p>At the end of her career, Rhein Kraft says farewell to her friends, who all go on to their own paths. She and the trainer goes back to the park where they first met. Rhein Kraft says, "Don't forget that I have existed, and don't forget what I have left behind."</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/q14th0wwqd39dmijd60pq/IMG_4871_20250813.jpg?rlkey=ssd2lhi5w4b6k261bj9pntebp&raw=1"><center>Don't forget that the Rhein Kraft, who have ran with you, had existed."</center><hr><p>You know, I started her career thinking it's just a lighthearted training story where she learns there are other ways to shine than winning Triple Tiara. I was not prepared for the emotional whiplash at the climax of her story, I could physically feel my jaw dropping.</p><p>At first, I simply thought she is a hopeful girl whose presence influenced others to chase after their dreams as well. And she started the strange dreams, and I was a little concerned. "How did she manage to sleep through all that? She wouldn't sleep even longer and never wake up next time... Right?" When she's sent to the hospital, I actually felt my heart drop, especially how well the writing conveyed the grief. The trainer got extremely distraught by her coma, and had a hard time believeing she wasn't just simply napping, and they kept on waiting for her to wake up, but to no avail. Even though I know she will wake up eventually (making her sleep forever would be against the spirit of Pretty Derby I think), I genuinely got invested into the story, I'm actually relieved when she woke up.</p><p>Though she got a happy ending instead of a sad one, it doesn't really reduce the amount of bittersweetness I felt for her story. Her whole story is about leaving behind a legacy, her real life counterpart died young, but the fact this version of her lived on makes it feel like this is her reincarnation, a manifestation of her passion and dreams. Her life may be short, but her life is forever preserved in this game, establishing the message that "Legacy doesn't just mean raising your next generation, but also the influence to the people". Seriously rambling this much about a horse girl gacha game is not part of my 2025 bingo card but here we are.</p><p>I actually heard that Rhein Kraft has an emotional story from some posts of the fans, but I did not know, and certainly did not expect, that the writers portrayed her story so beautifully. Maybe I should watch more of Pretty Derby's stories...</p><p class="date">( 13 Aug 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
