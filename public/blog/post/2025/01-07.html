But only after telling my sister "Oh hey my fingertip skin didn't fall off this season" that it actually happened, damn I jinxed myself...</p><h2>Fingertip skin?</h2><p>Oh you haven't known that about me? My fingertips are quite strange, the skin always goes flaky and falls off usually every winter. While it doesn't harm my body very much, it is certainly annoying, and painful at times. Picture a hand, but at the fingertips, the outer layer skin falls off, it isn't bleeding, but the exposed surface is red and smooth.</p><p>There are multiple annoying things about this, one minor thing about it is that it is difficult to flip book pages, as it requires the friction of the fingertips (which my peeled fingers don't have). Also, fingerprint readers often have a hard time reading my fingertips, my phone is fine somehow, but if I happen to travel abroad during this period, I might encounter these readers at the airport, which might be a little frustrating. However, the MOST annoying thing is my fingertips HURT. Not painful pain, but everytime I use my fingers, there's a stinging sensation, which obviously doesn't feel good.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is yet to be a treatment I can find that can stop this. I have visited doctors multiple times about this condition, but the medicine they prescribed didn't work. Applying mosturizers and hand cream doesn't work either, even though they smell nice. Have I tried not peel off the flaky bits, which was a bad habit of mine? Yea, I actually stopped this habit years before, but the skin still falls off on its own.</p><p>Funny story, one time dad tried to help me with my fingertip situation. He first made me apply Vaseline onto my hands, then let me wear plastic gloves to cover my hands overnight. I think he actually tried this method when he was in a situation similar to mine. Unfortunately, that method backfired. During midnight, my hands became insanely itchy, so I immediately took off the gloves, washed my hands, and held ice packs to ease the itch. Had to see the doctor the next day :/</p><p>I think after that experience, I kinda gave up finding a cure, perhaps it is something I have to deal with the rest of my life. I'm not very mad though, it isn't the worst thing a human can handle. But it would be nice if it can just go away on its own someday.</p><p class="date">( 7 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
