It's standard introverted kid thing maybe, or maybe it's because I was bullied idk. So growing up, I tend to have a lot of trouble in presentations and talking to strangers. Everytime I have to speak in front of a crowd, I often speak too quietly and my brain couldn't focus from the stress.</p><p>Aside from the counselling I have, I never really learnt to cope with the stress of being in social environments. However, I had something which I never understood how, which is getting over the shyness I have. Ever since going to university, I don't appear as timid as before, and when I have to do presentations, I seem to able to manage it quite well.</p><p>Being told that I am introverted my entire life, I often picture myself as a shy person. I find my fear of talking to people quite annoying, it feels like it is the thing stopping me from being a functional person. And for some reason, when I confessed my situation, people often say I don't act as socially anxious as most socially anxious people. But how though, was the counselling that effective?</p><p>Honestly, I'm quite glad I've gotten this ability to act more confident. Because of this, I have less trouble dealing with events involve with dealing with people, and because of that, I don't have to deal with the shit of people complaining about me being too shy. This trait I have isn't perfect though, when I join events like gathering with university students, I might act chill on the outside, but I don't talk as much as an extroverted person would, so people around me will still point out I don't speak a lot.</p><p>Another unfortunate thing is that this trait consumes a lot of my energy. After I finish a presentation or interview, I often end up feeling extremely burnt out. This is what I am feeling right now, I had two interviews in a week, now I don't feel very right, ugh I'm so tired. I'm blessed to randomly have this ability, but man it sure is exhausting.</p><p class="date">( 11 May 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
