But it turns out, they don't, causing many people to be shameful of being in love.</p><p>While I am demisexual, I do have crushes, like I've mentioned before. I don't think I had much opportunity to talk to others about my crushes post-kindergarten. I had a crush on someone because he smiled at me instead of bullying me like the other kids in the kindergarten do, I yapped about him to my mom. But after kindergarten, I never told anyone, I suppose I learnt it is embarassing to tell anyone about my romantic interests as I grew up due to others' exagerated reactions, mentioned in my 24 Oct 2024 blog.</p><p>When I was growing up, people tend to poke fun at others for having crushes. And the only times people would share their romantic experiences are in truths-or-dares, which if you know already, it is the unfortable peer-pressure that makes you say your deepest secrets. But it's not only having a crush that people would make fun of you for, if you are slightly closer to someone opposite of your gender, they would still say you have a crush on said person. So basically, I learnt that showing the emotions of having a crush is a bad thing, and I didn't mention crushes a lot, I usually only tell it to people that I know will only meet once and never again.</p><p>Unfortunately, because of my fear of being made fun of, when I do have a crush, it is impossible to find anyone that I feel safe to talk about with. And one thing about having a crush is your emotions get overwhelming. While I am aware my criteria to liking someone is ridiculously low (I often enjoy the company of anyone who doesn't find me weird, but I mean almost everyone finds me not fun to be around), it is hard to think rationally. Even if there's other better things to think about, your brain can't stop.</p><p>When I look up on google to see if anyone have a similar experience as me, not only I found people who are also embarrassed about having crushes, but also traumatic experiences of their family making fun of them. I always thought I was too sensitive when it comes to people poking fun at me, as they often ridiculue me for not taking the jokes well. Seeing the people sharing their experiences and admitting how awful they felt makes me feel a bit more validated, I'm glad I am not being a sensitive crybaby like the adults say.</p><p>One important thing is that having crushes is normal, which I'm surprised that most people forget. Having crushes allow you to show a more vulnerable side of you to show up, and for some people like to take advantage of that for... what? A joke that isn't even funny? If everyone acts more normal about love, then people will have more courage about confessing love or being confessed to, or even showing platonic affection to others. Why does society find showing love (any kind of love actually) cringe anyways, it's what makes being alive so great.</p><p>We all should stop making others learn that being in love is cringe or whatever.</p><p class="date">( 19 Oct 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
