It will be very unorganised though.</p><h2>1. Flower of Love Nigiri</h2><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Flower_Love_Sushi.jpg/500px-Flower_Love_Sushi.jpg" alt="Flower of Love Nigiri"><p>Have you ever seen this type of sushi? This is Flower of Love Nigiri, a popular sushi variety in Hong Kong. For many years, I assumed it originated from Japan, but apparently it is designed by a Hong Kong sushi chef!</p><p>This sushi exists due to the chef wanting to mend his relationship with his wife, unable to buy 100 rose, he instead designed this sushi (which looks like a rose) and made 100 of them. While they broke up anyways, he sold them to his store, and received a lot of good feedback.</p><h2>2. Am I wasting my life?</h2><p>Recently, <a href="https://youtu.be/Brm71uCWr-I?si=VSQf_OuGyfQqaTLS" target="_blank">Kurzgesagt released a new video about quitting weed</a>. While I never touched weed or abused any drugs, the part about wasting your life away instead of doing meaningful things sounds quite scary, it's basically just depression. I started to think back in my life and panicking, as a socially-anxious person, I don't go out frequently and meet friends, and I often feel ashamed about not partying and socializing all the time.</p><p>But after thinking more than 5 seconds, I realised I don't need to have an explosively social life to have a good life. I have written a list of stuff that I feel proud about, I decided to keep track of them lest I feel anxious about not being as "sucessful" as a party animal (I'm not saying the video misleads people into thinking only a social life is a successful one, I'm just prone to feeling shame about being introverted).</p><h2>3. The only Youtube Sponsor segment I'd watch</h2><p>I really hate how ads are in literally everything, websites, before videos, after videos, between videos, and SOMETIMES ADDED BY THE CREATORS THEMSELVES. I always skip them before the speaker even starts rambling about the product they totally enjoyed.</p><p>However, there is one instance that I would watch through them, which is when the sponsor product matches the video theme. I have been watching the videos by Rachel and Jun, and I always enjoyed the snack box segments, their reactions don't feel forced as they do enjoy Japanese snacks, and a lot of their videos revolve around food as well. I still won't buy the products though lol.</p><h2>4. My Youtube Archive Player</h2><p>In my blog of <a href="../09-12.html">12 Sep</a>, I mentioned I made a video player with my downloaded Youtube videos. However, one problem is that the file size is too big, and there are many videos that I still want to watch, like teppanyaki videos. My solution is that I will archive the videos on <a href="preservetube.com" target="_blank">Preservetube</a>, then I can just play the video using the link. Downside is that I have to be online to access those videos, but I don't really mind.</p><h2>5. My revamped bedroom</h2><p>In my blog of <a href="../09-28.html">28 Sep</a>, I mentioned I got my own desk bed. After settling down, I have decorated and organised the desk quite a lot. First, I have got a lot more space to put my stationary and personal items. I really love how I can put my laptop and drawing tablet together without one overlapping the other, and how I can place my alcohol markers and the paper on the table instead on the bed or on the floor. Another great thing is that I got a bulletin board to decorate the empty wall, I have placed some keychains, photos and alcohol marker color palettes. I also tried to add some twines as decorations, but they fell off :(</p><hr><p>That's all today, I probably had other ideas, but I must have forgotten them all. I should go rest now, the past few days has been busy~</p><p class="date">( 9 Nov 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
