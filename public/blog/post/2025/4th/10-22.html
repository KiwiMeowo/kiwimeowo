The seasons feels like spring -> summer -> autumn (1 day) -> winter. However, autumn is very comfy, not scorching hot like summer, or dead cold like winter, and especially not humid and damp like spring.</p><p>One of the things I looked forward the most is waking up early in the morning, then when I go outside, I would feel the mix of cool wind and warm sunlight. It is one of the top greatest things being alive on Earth. It is such a shame this time period is so short, because after that the sky always looks grey.</p><p>While autumn feels good, I don't consider it as my favourite season, as it is too forgettable, and because it does not have a big holiday like summer does. Summer holidays are the best thing for students, I mean who doesn't love a 2-month long holiday? Some people say the cold of winter is more tolerable than summer because you can put more clothes on if you're cold, but you can't take off anything from the heat if you are already butt naked. However I disagree, while you can put on more clothes during the cold, it feels really itchy, sticky and stuffy underneath all that jackets and coats. While you get sweaty during summer, you can just go to shower afterwards, and it feels refreshing again, and that is way more comfortable than the sensory hell of itchy clothings.</p><p>Back to the topic of autumn, the temperature has been dropping very fast the past few days. I remember it being really hot last Sunday, but now there is only 19 C outside today. Changing the clothes for another season can be difficult, I always forget to bring a jacket or wear thicker clothing, then I had to face the cold ass wind outside. While the temperature should be bareable, the rain makes it colder than it should, and jesus christ it feels like blades cutting onto my skin. One thing I do look forward to is wearing my favourite scarf (and I am wearing it today!), I knitted it myself and it's very soft.</p><p>However, one thing I'm particularly scared of is I tend to be more depressed during the winter. While I am not diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder, I think I tend to feel a lot more alone during winters, my family were away a lot during my teenage winter days, and perhaps I started to associate winter with loneliness. My friend did say he will spend more time with me this winter, so that made me feel better :3</p><p class="date">( 22 Oct 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
