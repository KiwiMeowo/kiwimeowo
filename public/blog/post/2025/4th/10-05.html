To describe the party game, it is like the adventure dice game in Mii party (Or Mario party)... but with shooting. While you roll dice and go forward (or back depending on some special rules), enemies sometimes come up and you have to shoot them down.</p><p>Another thing was that the characters you play as were randomly assigned, and it just so happened that my character was a buff woman with long, pink hair. Mmm muscular woman.</p><p>Despite how many times things won't go my way, in this dream, I performed shockingly well. I kept winning the minigames and I managed to fend off all the enemies with my shooting skills. The only times I messed up are me getting a debuff, and the group minigame that everyone failed because they all misunderstood the rules.</p><p>There was a round before the boss, and we all got to rest a bit. Some of the group went to chill, and some of us stayed at the entrance to check for enemies(including me). One second, we were just relaxing near the entrance, next moment, there were several figures in a distance, holding rifles. The moment I shouted to alert everyone, chaos ensued.</p><p>The battle was intense, like watching an epic anime battle. I got to use my dream ability of flying through walls and floors, and with the help of other teammates, we defeated most of the enemies, just one left.</p><p>However, that particular enemy was particularly strong, we were injured badly, almost no more energy to stand up. Apparently, she knew a lot about us (the characters), maybe she stalk us in our daily life. Because of that, she knew a lot about our weaknesses. While I wish I know what happens next, my brain woke up quite soon.</p><p>I'm feeling quite bored lately, so I'm glad I something interesting to think about. Man I'm bored.</p><p class="date">( 5 Oct 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
