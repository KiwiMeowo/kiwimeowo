While I was freed from the torture called bullying after primary school, I wasn't a kid with many friends. I always felt like I was lacking something that others all have, despite all the adults assuring me I am normal. I really should get a test if I am neurodivergent, except it is kinda expensive...</p><p>Anyways, when I went to orientation day, there were various activities that require physical contact, including those with opposite genders. While playing that game, I was shocked to see I could touch the guys without them flinching or jumping away ten meters with a disgusted face. I was so happy, I'm finally not a disgusting monster to others!</p><p>Despite that, I was not satisfied yet. Though others accept me as a human being, they don't seem to see me as a potential friend, it's more like... a kid to take care of. In secondary school, our class is gathered together, and my teacher came up and said "As [my irl name] is quiet, you guys should let her join your group!" Well, the group did let me join them, but it felt ingenuine, like I know they only let me join because they felt pity on me. Whenever they chat together, I always sat quietly. And if I did speak up, the group would awkwardly answer me, it always felt the atmosphere got colder by one degree.</p><p>I am fine talking to a person one on one, because that person will only focus on me. But once, I'm in a group with two other people, I will turn invisible like I never existed. Maybe it's a good thing since the conversations are often boring... But I always felt like I'm a child to be taken care of. It feels people around me try to take care of me, "You should came play games together" "You can try eating this!" "You can follow us... If you want to" I can't tell if that is the care that acquantances do, or if they just feel the need to guide me. It's scary. I know I act naive sometimes, but is it wrong to wish I can feel like an equal, even if I'm bad at being a proper adult?</p><p>There is something wrong with me, this is a statement I assumed true in my head. I don't know how to improve, people either say I am completely fine, or give me advice that I really despise (like faking a hobby). While I am treated far better than the past, I still felt like an outcast sometimes.</p><p>However, there is one miraculous time where I feel like a human in a group of 3. After an event, me and two other guys went to get some midnight snacks. We chatted about what we did that day, while we shared some spicy food. I realised that time, that I got to chat with them without the air suddenly getting cold, it felt natural, it felt welcoming. It was one of the best social moments in my life I think.</p><p>I think just that one incident that made me less scared of human interation, I wish I can chat with others again like that, no pretending to be normal, no worrying about being weird, just being myself and happy.</p><p class="date">( 30 Oct 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
