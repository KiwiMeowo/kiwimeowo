It's the language that most people understand, and I find it more easy to type than Chinese. However, sometimes I feel strange that how little I feel connected to the Hong Kong side of the Internet despite being a Hongkonger myself.</p><p>In my early days of being on the Internet, I already find myself on the western side more frequently, watching Minecraft videos made by English speakers. And sometimes, I'd encounter Chinese speakers, but most of the times they are from Taiwan. On Facebook, the Chinese speakers I friended are all Taiwanese, it seems the people which interests I align with are rarely Hongkongers.</p><p>In my various phases, like Danganronpa, Land of Lustrous, Cookie Run, I always accepted that there are likely very little fans of these in Hong Kong. My sister always says my interests are too niche, most people in Hong Kong are more interested in stuff like TV dramas (ew) and K-pop stars (not a fan of real people). One thing I can't do is change myself, even if pretending to be, lying is one thing I am bad at. But Hong Kong is very small and busy, most people don't have time to ramble about some game or anime like I do all the time...</p><p>However, few years ago, me and my sister went to an anime exhibition, where many anime/game fans cosplay or sell fan merchandises. Going there, I finally realised Land of Lustrous fans do exist in real life, there are more people who play Cookie Run than I thought, Blue Lock is a very, VERY popular anime! Going there, I finally feel like I am not alone in this land, I am not the only geek here.</p><p>I actually met up with another Cookie Run player few years ago. I believe it was my first time meeting an online friend, which felt surreal as my schools always warned online people are all dangerous. However, my online friend was quite chill, I felt a bit awkward talking to a person about Cookie Run in Cantonese, I mostly play Cookie Run in English after all. I think it was a good experience though, like wow another Cookie Run fan,,,</p><p>I kinda wish I can see more Hong Kong people who have the same interests as me. Well I did stop using Facebook for my sanity, though it was the only platform I can find Chinese-speakers in the same fandoms as me. I think I should find a way to type more in Chinese, just gotta figure out a way to start...</p></div><p class="date">( 18 May 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
