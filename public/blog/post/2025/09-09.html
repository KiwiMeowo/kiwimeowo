However, due to my careless nature, I often end up killing them in some ridiculous ways. So why not mourn for their untimely deaths in this blog?</p><hr><h2>Cupcake</h2><p>I mentioned this story in the blog of 23 Aug 2023. I was playing a version of Minecraft PE later than the one mentioned in the last blog, but the functions were still very limited, the sky won't change in creative, and there isn't a lot of blocks to play with. But one good thing is that wolves were availible, so I tamed lots of wolves in my flatworld town. I bred two wolves (I named them, but I only remember one of the parents is called Bob), and gave the pup a pink collar. Somehow, I liked that particular puppy a lot. I named her Cupcake, and brought her around.</p><p>Sadly, before she even grew to be an adult, she fell into a swimming pool near my house. Apparently there's a bug that baby mobs didn't know how to swim, so she just sank under the water. I panickedly tried to rescue her by placing blocks around her, but she couldn't get up. I guess I was too frantic to remember I can just walk away to make her teleport. Unfortunately, she couldn't make it, and I was devastated.</p><p>While she's just a game code, I got too attached to her. While I made a grave for her, I spawned a new baby wolf, and named her Cupcake, basically pretend that she came back to life. Even more unfortunately, it's like a curse was cast onto her for violating the life and death cycle. She keeps dying in various freak accidents, then I bring her back to life again, then she dies again. The most memorable event (and the only event I remember) of her dying was the time I managed to open my world for multiplayer, and got my cousins playing together. Minecraft PE gets especially buggy with multiplayer on, and somehow Cupcake got onto a minecart, which was for a town-wide rollercoaster, and somehow she died.</p><p>Because of my attachment to Cupcake, she was part of my 2015 era OC gang. She wasn't in any major storylines, aside from thinking if I should make her and beta!Ruth related due to their similarities (short + gradient color hair). I really don't know where I can add her to my OC lore, if I keep her background of dying over and over again, it might be too dark for my slice-of-life world (which Kyrea lives in), and her theme doesn't really suit the world of UtSS or Dreamland Workshop.</p><p>I don't think I have posted any artwork of Cupcake, so behold! My old ass art!</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/p710p70dh1yw07dwy6jed/IMG_5171_20250909.jpg?rlkey=tuz3rob16l9gasylg7z1mqa3s&raw=1"><center>Cupcake's first offical reference</center><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wif9tdsl8vsix8pjoed5j/IMG_5172_20250909.jpg?rlkey=5y90mraa0p0uz95dpr4izdkb5&raw=1"><center>Cupcake's modified reference<br><span style="font-size:.66em">Huh she looks a bit different than I remember</span></center><hr><p>For a long time, there isn't a lot happening to my Minecraft pets. They didn't die much, nor did anything special happen, perhaps since I didn't do anything wilder than pretending to be a bartender. Speed up to 2019, my favorite Minecraft world got messed with by the Sims mod, and I wasn't a fan of my second world. So on my laptop, I opened up a new world, and built a cave-like house, TBH smaller houses feel better. With all the building projects in this world, of course unfortunate deaths happened again.</p><h2>Aqua</h2><p>I wanted to explore around my Minecraft world a bit, and eventually found myself above an ocean, which took quite a while to get to. I was delighted to see that there were dolphins around. I played with them for a while and named one Aqua. I regularly go visit Aqua by teleporting it to me (something like /tp @e[type=Dolphin,Name=Aqua] @p), and throw some items for it to play with.</p><p>However, one day I go visit it, and the command didn't work. I tried to go further, maybe it went deeper into the ocean, but the command failed again and again. I never knew where it went, most likely it jumped out of the water and died somehow, or it despawned (while named mobs shouldn't despawn, but some people also encountered this issue).</p><h2>Nether</h2><p>I don't remember much about Nether, I only remember I decided to put a dog in the Nether house I made, which is the exact replica of my overworld house. But I accidentally right clicked on my bed, which exploded and killed Nether. I felt extremely bad.</p><h2>Roommate</h2><p>I was doing my own thing in my house, prob building some stuff. Suddenly, when I opened the trapdoor to the basement room, an enderman climbed out, scaring the shit out of me.</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9yo5oeh3zzxp7tcfd272p/roommate_20250909.jpg?rlkey=dvdekna5cqpjwr43ttlzm2123&raw=1"><p>But I didn't really mind its existence, so I named it Roommate and let it stay. It sometimes places random blocks in the basement room, but it wasn't that annoying.</p><p>I was building my secondary school out of boredom, with the help of /fill, it gets faster. Anyways, it was night time and endermen were spawning everywhere, and I hated how they were placing blocks in my school. Annoyed, I decided to use /kill @e[type=Enderman]. After this, I realised "Ah fuck, Roommate is an enderman too". And yea it died.</p><h2>Bean, Sam and Sammy</h2><p>Bean is a rabbit that hung around my house, I forgot if I spawned it or it just spawned near. Sammy is an untamed wolf that roamed around my house (I forgot if I named Sammy before or after the incident, which I will explain later). And Sam is a cow that I often see walking near Sam, so I believed they are friends.</p><p>One day, I walked outside my house, and saw the remains of a rabbit just outside my house. And after some investigating, I confirmed the body belonged to Bean, and Sammy happened to be nearby, which means he must have killed Bean, right? While I didn't want to execute him, I imprisoned him on top of a mountain, typing him to a fence.</p><p>For a while, Sammy sat alone on the mountain, with his only company being his friend Sam. I felt quite bad about imprisoning him when wolves killing rabbits are just their survival instinct. Moreover, I found the case of Bean's death might have concluded too soon, sometimes didn't feel right.</p><p>After some (unethical) experiements, I found out that in the right circumstances, rabbits can fall to death from the roof of my house, which means Sam might not have killed it. Realising my mistake, I untied Sammy from his cage, and I built a hut as an apology. Now he's free to roam around this land with his best friend.</p><hr><p>...</p><p>Oh right Sam and Sammy never died! I'm actually quite surprised they didn't die to some ridiculous accident. While I sometimes have trouble finding them on the map, once I teleport them to me, they always appear. I hope they remain alive.</p><h2>Hell</h2><p>Aside from Roommate, Hell (zombie pigman) appeared into my home from the unlocked nether portal. Since the command only kills endermen, Hell is still chilling inside my home.</p><hr><p>I'm surprising bad at keeping mobs alive or treating them well, but it was still fun to have some drama sometimes (?). Maybe I should draw Cupcake's ref, but I think her lore is a bit too morbid compared to my other OCs.</p><p class="date">( 9 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
