When I was very young, my dad got a Wii console, this console isn't as old as my DS, but it is still a major part of my life.</p><hr><h2>Wii Sports Resort</h2><p>One of the earliest games I played was Wii Sports Resort, it contains games like sword fighting, parachuting, archery and stuff. It was one of the games we spent the most time playing.</p><p>My sister seemed to enjoy sword fighting the most, as I most often saw her playing it. However, I was not as into it, as I often lose the matches with her, I had pretty bad motor skills as a child I guess. What's more interesting for me is Showdown, where you can fight a bunch of Miis and even push them off a cliff. I think I managed to beat all the levels from the first section, but not on the second section since it was too difficult.</p><p>Cycling was very fun as well, you play it by using the remote and the nunchucks, you shake them like stepping on the pedals on the bicycle. One catch is that the Mii you are using will run out of energy if you swing them too fast, the mii riding the cycle will pant tiredly and drink water from their bottle, it was very funny. It was quite satisfying to speedily go through the roads, especially when going down a slope.</p><p>While I don't play the basketball game when I first started playing this game, pretty sure I had quite a lot of difficulties playing it. But when I got a little bit older, I decided to challenge this mode. That time, I got the grasp of the mode, and beat several teams. Sadly, I met a team of girls, and I got stuck in that particular level. I kept trying so many times, and imagining that group was the bullies in kindergarten. I think I managed to beat that level, but not the one after that.</p><p>Perhaps the one I like the most was Island Flyover, the mode with the most freedom. You can fly around the island without restriction (unless if you try to fly out of the island range), what's great is it's a good opportunity to fly into tiny corners, like a certain cave that is barely big enough for a plane, or the volcano. It can be somewhat difficult, but it is still funny to die many times in tight corners. Another fun thing to do with the plane is sailing across the river/ocean like a boat.</p><hr><h2>Wii Fit Plus</h2><p>We also got the board for the game, it's a game where you can exercise and play at the same time. While there are tutorials for workouts, we enjoy playing the minigames more. There were a lot of games there, like marching and kungfu, but for some reason the one I remember the most is jogging. There's a mode where you have to remember the surronding details, and at the end of the jog, you have to answer a few questions about the details. There's also a mode that you can follow a person while joggin, and mid way if you encounter a dog/cat running past, you can choose to follow the dog/cat instead by outrunning the person. As a child who liked pets, I never pass on the chance of following them. I also spent a lot of time just jogging on free run, for some reason. I guess I found it relaxing.</p><hr><h2>Super Mario Bros Wii</h2><p>When our cousins come to visit, one of the things we often do is play Super Mario Bros Wii. Since none of us are good at platforming games, most of the times we end up dying in dumb ways. The funniest way is to step on one of our characters and causing someone's death. It gets frustrating, but it's funny.</p><hr><h2>Wii Party</h2><p>Another very good game is Wii Party, suitable to play with many people, a party game. There were two 4 players game modes we often play, the dice map one, and the bingo. I think we also just play the minigames alone more, the most memorable ones are the horse racing, the baby game (we didn't know how to play it, so we often took more time than needed), the tree swing (I could never get the timing right smh), the stage light, and the barrel timing (I think I managed to get the perfect timing multiple times). Even when simply playing the minigames alone, I had a lot of great time.</p><hr><p>It has been a long time I last played the Wii, but I had a lot of fond memories playing it. I still remember the summer holidays where me and my cousins play games. While I can play the games alone, it doesn't hit the same as having others playing with you. A lot of things are more fun when there's other people playing with you, I think it applies to a lot of the things I like. While I like certain things just for me and not for others, I think if I know other people also like drawing or some media I enjoy, it's double the enjoy if I get to enjoy the media with others. I can play it alone, but how fun is it when the party games (meant for groups) is played alone?</p><h2>There are other games I remember playing, but I don't think I remember a lot about them. TBH, I should pick up my Wii again.</h2><p class="date">( 28 May 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
