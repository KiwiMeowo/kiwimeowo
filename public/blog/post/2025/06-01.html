The story of the song is a mouse trying to survive in a household, struggling to find food. One day, it found treats on the stovetop, feeling grateful for the human's kind act, it enjoyed the meal. Unfortunately for the mouse, it did not know the food was poisoned, and it passed away inside its den at the end.</p><p>From what I've heard, Will Wood encountered a mouse in his house, as much as he wanted to befriend it, it would not be very safe since it might carry diseases. At the end, he had to kill it with poison. This story explores the cruelty of life, the mice want to live, the humans want to be healthy, neither of these mindsets are wrong, but they can't be both satisfied at the same time, and that's just nature. What's more tragic was the naivety of the mouse, when being met with treats, it fully expected a friend, and even though it got poisoned, it never blamed the person. It simply mourned over how its life suddenly got cut short, "Nature I guess".</p><p>This song is one of my top favourites from Will Wood, it expresses the feeling of hopelessness very well, while "Nature I guess" appears in the lyrics many times, seeming to express that it is just what it is, but this kind of acceptance is sorrowful. The more I listened to it, the more I feel sad, it's just very melancholic and beautiful.</p><hr><p>Today, I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/GqVvrB3QUJw?si=n3OstgAr-u51m-RY" target="_blank">a cover of Tomcat Disposables</a>, I decided to give it a listen before I sleep. The song started quite nice, though I was kinda confused about the comments saying this is the good ending. When my attention drifted away from the video, the lyrics suddenly changed, it wasn't the ones I remember?</p><blockquote><p>But right before I bite, the child's eyes meet with mine. I don't know why, but my, we're both scared!</p></blockquote><p>I was quite surprised the singer changed the lyrics, and altered the final outcome. Instead of the mouse dying of poison, the mouse got surprised and ran back into its home. While it expected to starve one more day, it was shocked to see a kind hand giving it water and cheese. At long last, the mouse had its stomach filled with a heartful meal. Instead of a message of how one life has to kill others for the sake of oneself, the mouse learns that its life is indeed valued equally among other beings.</p><p>There are times where I feel changing a sad story to a happy one redundant, making the outcome happy sometimes removes a meaningful message. However, I feel like this song is more on exploring a different message within this tragic story, its perhaps a message on how kindness still exists in this cruel world.</p><p>What makes me especially emotional is how the mouse gets to live another day, the singer did a good job expressing the mouse's desperation to live, and gratefulness towards the one giving it a meal.</p><p>When the singer (or the mouse) sings softly about seeing the hand offering water and cheese, my heart hurted a little. I've listened to the tragic story of Tomcat Disposables, now the mouse finally has a happy ending, and a friend like it wanted. The way the lyrics reflected the original ones, and changed a bit of words to change a lot of meaning, it brought so much emotional impact to the cover.</p><p>Cover:</p><blockquote><p>And so, I back off back to bed. I've been hungry for three nights, I'll make it four and save my head.</p><p>But as I mumble down to sleep, a helping hand appears; a humble meal of water and cheese.</p><p>One small act of quiet, warm peace. A night spent full and eased. The glint still left in my mind.</p><p><i>Let a sigh out as I close my eyes. One day ends, the next begins. That's for the best.</i></p></blockquote><p>Original:</p><blockquote><p>And so I stumble back to bed. Something’s not quite right. Guess I’ll just go rest my head</p><p>Now as I lay me down to sleep, I expect no dreams, and no sweet goodbye to me</p><p>Flatline in the morning light. I held on so tight for so long It’s just not</p><p><i>Right, let a sigh out as I close my eyes. Was that all there was to this? What’s for the best?</i></p></blockquote><p>When the mouse closed its eyes and sighed, it wasn't despair and embracing for death, but a genuine relief that it finally felt peace. Instead of dying in the morning, it gets to survive another day, and instead of questioning <u>"What’s for the best?"</u>, it says <u>"That's for the best."</u>. Man I love parallels.</p><hr><p>Speaking of alternative endings to Tomcat Disposables, Will Wood announced a game based of this song, which is called <a href="https://youtu.be/Z1wYp-KUxFo?si=11aQbNRPmnYIG6ty" target="_blank">Éalú</a>. It appears that the style of the game will be similar to the music video, a world made with wood, and we will play as the mouse solving puzzles. I wonder what WW is planning for us, maybe more heart-wrenching stories.</p><p class="date">( 1 Jun 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
