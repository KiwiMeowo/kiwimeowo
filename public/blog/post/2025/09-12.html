Also, Elon Musk does a lot of stuff that makes Twitter less and less good, like adding grok or whatever. However, since cutting off social media can be difficult, addiction and habits stuff.</p><hr><p>So back in August, Wplace was trending and everyone went to post the stuff they saw. But for some reason, people started hating on Deltarune for being everywhere in Wplace. Like, that is quite a dumb reason to hate this game? Later on, some Deltarune fans started to grief Umamusume art, which caused a discourse, and caused people to hate Deltarune even more. As someone who likes Deltarune, Umamusume and Wplace, I really hate to see people being so bitter in here. I decided to delete Twitter from my phone to save my mental health.</p><p>But honestly, even if I delete Twitter, I wouldn't miss much anyways. Like aforementioned, majority of the tweets nowadays are very negative, and comments are negative, the retweets are negative. Even with the Blue Check blocker, the bots and ragebait tweets never end. I want to see stuff on the Internet to be happy, not to be even more miserable. Second of all, the content people make are quite stupid. They always recycle old trending tweets, a cheap way to get attention, maybe promote some random product in the comments.</p><p>And like I said in the blog of 16 Dec 2024, I'm not a fan of jokes based on lies, and Twitter has lots of them. People always pretend to be stupid and tweet something like "LOL I DID SOME STUPID THING WHICH IS TOTALLY NOT INTENTIONAL". In Instagram, I saw a post sharing a tweet and a QRT, the OP said "I'm trying to find a meme that looks like this", and attached is an drawn image recreating the meme... except the original image is behind the layer, slightly opague. In the QRT, the OP of the tweet is like "Omg I totally forgot to turn off the layer lmaoooo". Yea definitely, you totally didn't leave the layer on intentionally and post it to Twitter pretending to be dumb to get likes. Glad to know the quality of tweets is the same as the day I left it behind :/.</p><hr><p>Anyways, ever since I deleted Twitter, the time I spent on there significantly dropped. There are times I opened Twitter on my laptop, but I didn't spend longer than two hours in a day. So far, the un-Twitter-fication has been successful. So, what did I do instead of doomscrolling on Twitter?</p><h2>"Youtube"</h2><p>I spend a lot of time watching videos, probably more than Twitter before I even quit it. While I wouldn't say the algorithm on Youtube is good, at least the videos it shared are just boring but not enraging.</p><p>However, recently Youtube did a age-restriction policy for some reason, and people started a (poorly-organised) boycott. While I'm not sure the policy would impact me or not, I figured I should try taking action. Lately, I have been reducing the use of Youtube... by downloading the videos I watch the most.</p><p>While I can just watch the videos I downloaded through my folders, I think the steps is somewhat annoying. If I want to watch a video while I'm doing something, I have to click four times: Click finder, click my downloaded videos folder, click the video I wanna watch, then click play... It's inconvenient! So, I built an HTML page that mimics the UI of Youtube, I can just open the page, click on the video I wanna watch on the sidebar, then it would play. I think the major problem is that the video size can be very big, the folder size at this time is almost 10GB, but I'm not sure if I should compress them...</p><p>I occasionally do have to look for new videos to watch, it can be a bit boring to watch the same videos over and over. I wish I can save all of the teppanyaki videos out there, but that would be a lot of GBs...</p><h2>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</h2><p>Like I said on <a href="09-02.html">in Sep 2</a>, I have been playing GPGP more to spend time on the train. Instead of scrolling Twitter for half an hour, I can stimulate my brain making pizzas <s>and being yelled at for adding tomato sauce instead of pesto</s>. The best part about playing this game is that it does not require Internet connection to play.</p><h2>Instagram</h2><p>Not gonna lie, the algorithm of Instagram is far better than Twitter's. While the comment section of Instagram can be a shithole and many of reels is just ranting about being harrassed by toxic comments, a lot of my reels are cute animal reels due to my friends sending me cute reels.</p><hr><p>While people say it is good to keep up with news, but I don't really have the energy to read them when most of them is negative and remind me that there is nothing that can make things better. I'll just focus on art and studies for now.</p><p class="date">( 12 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
