Wow, I don't think I have graduated secondary school when it was first announced, time flies!</p><p>What is ƎNA, you ask? It was a series by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoelG" target="_blank">Joel G</a>, it's certainly something, quite like looking at abstract artwork with no context. I remember seeing Temptation Stair in my recommended, and I was so confused. Believing I require the context from the previous videos, I looked for the earlier ƎNA episodes... Only to become even more confused. To understand the ƎNA, you only need to know there's ƎNA and Moonie, the rest is quite nonsensical and abstract. While the first ƎNA video is more cartoon-like, the rest are more exploration games-like. ƎNA (Our POV) would be given a quest from the NPCs (Sometimes speaking in languages other than English), and they (Actually what pronouns does ƎNA use?) would go further to whatever goal they wanted to reach.</p><p>I recommend you to check out the videos first, while watching them might not explain how strange the worldbuilding is, there are quite a bit of references of them in Dream BBQ.</p><hr><p>In the story, ƎNA (who isn't the ƎNA from the youtube videos, I think ƎNAs are a species or smth) is employed, and is trying to find the boss. But to find the boss, they have to get rid of the smoke first. To get rid of the smoke, they have to find the <s>Genie</s> Bathroom. Like the ƎNA videos, there are plenty of NPCs often speaking in bizzare ways, they are fun to talk to. I like the Korean Businesswoman though, she's pretty.</p><p>I actually don't really know how to explain this game, due to how abstract the story is. Though I think it is a bit more coherent than the videos, either because Joel G and the developers don't want to confuse the players too much, or I have already gotten used to the insanity. I don't think the game is very long, I probably have a game time less than two hours, probably would've been a bit longer if I explored more carefully.</p><p>Your brain might get very confused if you never watched the ƎNA series before, and it would be more painful if you have motion sickness like me. But like I said, it feels like looking at abstract art, the artstyle is wonderful, it is a mix of 3D world and 2D characters. If you enjoy a game with cool artstyle, I suggest to try out the game for yourself! A little reminder is that there's a parkour section that is a bit hard to go through due to the strong wind, man it reminds me of the times I'm trying to beat the wind trial in Sky: COTL.</p><hr><center><h2>Rating: ★★★☆☆</h2><br><p>I failed the parkour too many times :(</p></center></div><p class="date">( 30 Mar 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
