I can promise that I did draw something. Typing in Cangjie is hard.</p><p>Few days ago, I had an online interview, a website recorded me some normal interview questions. I assumed that it would use English, so I wasn't too nervous. But I realised I have to introduce myself using Chinese, which scared the hell out of me. The interview went well, but the interviewers might think I don't speak Cantonese well even though I am a HongKonger XD. I don't know if writing a blog in Cantonese on April Fools is funny, I think it's still a cool challenge.</p><p>Speaking of April Fools, do you guys actually celebrate it? I only heard of this festival when I was growing up, but I never participated in it. I'd assume people from other places would do more stuff with it, but HongKongers don't really do anything outside of the Internet. In the Internet, I often see Youtubers or other celebrities pretend to quit, only to reveal it's an April Fools joke at the end of the video or somewhere else. It's funny the first or second time, but when everyone does it, or even do it every year, it's going to get old.</p><p>But when I started playing Cookie Run, when April Fools came, there was a new game mode, where Gingerbrave got a strange trial, even the background and obstacles are drawn with MSPaint. That's when I realised April Fools can be so creative. My favourite April Fools event is the mushroom event in Kingdom, every cookie's appearances got changed. I'm so surprised Cookie Run prepares these events with so much care every year.</p><p>Some people might not enjoy April Fools, they might have gotten hurt because they got pranked, if they call those people out, they end up being seen as no fun. As a result, they see pranks as an awful act. I was a very sensitive kid, because I was constantly made fun of, I wasn't a big fan of pranks and jokes. But after playing Cookie Run, I realised jokes don't have to be at the expense of anyone. Unlike most festivals, April Fools allows a great range of creativity, just doing anything that is out of the ordinary can make people laugh. If the only joke a person can think of is hurting others, then perhaps that guy isn't very fun to hang around.</p><p>Last year I made an <a href="../../art/AprilFools/2024/index.html" target="_target">joke version</a> of my OCs' profile pics, among them my favourite is Lavender who looks dead inside. I didn't do memes this time, but this new joke might match the theme of this website. I hope you guys can enjoy!</p><p>Wish you guys have a happy April Fools!
