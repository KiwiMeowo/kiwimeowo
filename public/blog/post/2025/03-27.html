Because this is how I'm feeling</p></div><p class="blogtag"><span>Tags: Life</span></p><div class="text"><p>So the course I was taking is about mobile application making. I had two choices to pick from, other one about networking I think. Knowing myself to be decent in coding, I decided to pick this one. Honestly I was somewhat worried, because being too confident might lead to my downfall.</p><p>We first learnt Android Studio, you can emulate android devices and make applications using Java or Kotlin. Having no knowledge in Java, it was quite difficult for me to understand what's going on. And the classes only explains the application making process and the software needed, and not so much on coding languages.</p><p>But what's big for me is how they are teaching HTML, JS and Cordova. As you already know, I coded a lot of stuff in this website, and gathered a fair amount of knowledge using HTML and coding random stuff in JS. I was quite excited how HTML is part of this course, because I already know majority of the stuff already.</p><p>What's more there's a project where you need to get JSON files from the Bus Route API, and put them in a application. Although we haven't started the project, I tried to build the basic idea on my own, and it was surprisingly easy. And it was thanks to me deciding to get lazy and use a fetch function to get the content from one page to another.</p><p>I think I mentioned this before. As an artist, when I upload a new art, I'd want the newest art to show on the first page. However, it would be tedious for me to add the art in the art page, then go to the index page to paste it there. It's only one extra step, but it is probably enough to lower my motivation to update the site, and considering I was using the Neocities Editor (which sometimes gets laggy), in the long run it would cost me a lot of time.</p><p>The way fetch command works is that it can obtain the data from a page, json file or whatever. After getting access, you can extract the stuff you want, then you can slap it to desired spot. It took me quite a lot of research and corrections to get it properly working, I still remember spending hours to make the rest of the JS script I made to run before the fetch function, or else some stuff wouldn't work. While it was a lot of work, or too much work for something so insignificant, I was quite proud of myself to accomplish something like this on my own.</p><p>Honestly, saying the work is pointless isn't right anymore, because I actually have to use the fetch function in the project. After a few tries, the thing is working properly. I couldn't believe the work I did as a silly hobbist is actually useful! I guess being too lazy to manually update both the art page and index has its perks :P</p><p>Life is a bit stressful lately, and I guess that reduced my mood on creating new art or blogs. Or maybe you guys can comment down suggestions on what I should talk about or write, that'd be cool!</p></div><p class="date">( 27 Mar 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
