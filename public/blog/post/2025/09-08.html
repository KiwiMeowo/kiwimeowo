In my experience, I often just do normal stuff, the 'worst' I did was marrying a guy just to stay in his house to not spend money on food, also his house is better anyways. Also there's one time I kicked a neighbour's trash can for a quest, I felt so bad I ran away immediately. Seeing how people treat their Sims, I was like "Man I'm sure is tame in terms of gaming..." Then the memories of me playing Minecraft came back.</p><p>In the version of Minecraft PE I used to play, there were very limited things to do, far less blocks, no commands, no time changes in creative mode, and you can't really throw items in creative. Still, I found ways to build some amateur but cool buildings, one thing is a conveyor belt using water. While I think it is very cool to move one item from point A to B, I couldn't really throw items from my inventory. An easy way for items to drop is killing animals, if I trap and kill a bunch of mobs in one spot above the water, then they will be moved by the water, <a href="/secret/TRANSPORTATION!!!.jpg" target="_blank" class="secret">transportation!!!</a></p><p>Another thing I made was the animal cooking system. In old PE, you can't access blocks with functions such as chests, crafting table and furnaces, which means I can't cook stuff, which takes away the immersion of play pretend a bit. But eventually, I found out I can get cooked meat by setting the mobs on fire. At that time, flint and steel wasn't a thing in creative (I think), so I had to rely on lava. To avoid the meat getting burnt away in lava, I found out that I can make the animals fall from a high spot, make them pass through a layer of lava, and make them fall to death to safely get the cooked meat. Using the water conveyor belt just now, I can spawn a bunch of animals into the water stream, make them fall through the lava and onto the ground, and finally get lots of delicious meat on the ground. When I pick them up, it looks like I'm eating them, and the popping sound of item picking sfx is satisfying! Yum!</p><hr><p>The mechanism above is somewhat forgivable since auto meat farm is a thing, though others make it for survival while I do it for fun. However, the next thing is quite worse.</p><p>With me obtaining Minecraft: Java Edition, I now have my hands on redstone. My redstone stuff is rather flimsy, but they do their jobs, and that's what matters. I mainly used them for auto lights and piston doors, but the most morbid thing I built was the hydraulic press. It consists of a 4x4 box and various pistons, a set of pistons on top that acts as a lid, and pistons on the both sides of the box. Why did I make this? I don't know, I just wanted to squish some mobs I guess. I would lure some mobs (or just spawn them) into the box, then I would close the lid so that they won't jump out, and I would activate the mechanism, and watch them slowly or quickly squish to death and have items spray out.</p><p>Back then, there were websites that give out free Minecraft accounts, I have no idea where they obtained the accounts, most likely hacking maybe. Anyways I got one account from there at some point, because ,first, I really wanted a player to visit my world, even if that player is another me. And second, I wanted to put the player into the mechanism for the lols. So I squished them multiple times until I get bored. I also squished myself to death multiple times as well. Man I sure was bored.</p><p>Minecraft is a sandbox game that allows players to freely express their creativity, even if said creativity is a torture device that doesn't do anything meaningful. I should play Minecraft more, maybe even with my sister.</p><p class="date">( 8 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
