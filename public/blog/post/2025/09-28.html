Like I mentioned in the blog of 24 Mar 2024, the room isn't very big, it gets stuffy easily, and there isn't a lot of space I can place my stuff. I was really saddened at the fact I could never have my own bedroom, I sometimes see TV shows with teen characters having a bedroom the size of my living room, and I get very jealous.</p><p>Fast forward in the future, I am the only one who uses the bedroom. My sister, who used to share the same bedroom with me, proposes an idea to replace the old bunk bed with a new desk bed.</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o2z5glytxi07jq1hisixo/81goEfvumcL._UF894-1000_QL80__20250928.jpg?rlkey=0ya1ye2najtu9op3fcazq8rz2&raw=1"><center>Picture for reference</center><p>With a desk bed, I can work in my bedroom without needing to slouch my back sitting on my bed (there is a table but no chair can fit in my room, cuz the room is too small), I have more space to place decorations and store stuff, and maybe get a larger bed frame so I stop bumping my body onto walls. Unfortunately, that means my sister has less space in my room.</p><p>However, I have to get over one obstacle: Which is getting used to sleeping on the upper bed. To go to my bed, I have to climb up onto the bed, change mattress sheets a bit harder, and feel afraid about falling off the bed. On the first day sleeping up there, because there is a cabinet, my body keeps bumping into there everytime I move my body. But otherwise, I slept quite well, I didn't mind the height, and I got used to climbing up and down the bed. I also bought a extension cable and stuck it near the bed, I can charge my phone up there. The upstair cabinets had to go though.</p><p>I did some research on the desk beds available in Hong Kong, I had several wishes for my desk bed:</p><ol><li>It has to have an area for desk bed (It wouldn't be a desk bed if it isn't the case!)</li><li>Stairs. If not, slanted ladders.</li><li>The frame separating the mattress and the air should be higher</li><li>NO CABINETS UPSTAIRS</li></ol><p>There are some desk beds that has everything I wanted, the problem is that my bedroom is too small, and many of them are too big to even put inside the room. Moreover, my sister is worried about purchasing beds from a less known brand, it is better to be safe than a fancy bed but collapses immediately. We settled on a brand that is well known, and also have most of my wishes. The ladder isn't slanted, but I think it's good enough.</p><hr><p>When the new bed arrived, the old bed frame has to be taken apart first. After the guy took apart the old bed (It's kinda bittersweet to see the bed we used for so long graduating), I only realised how spacious my bedroom is without the bed. I can even T-pose in the room without my hands touching the walls!! We also had to clean up the space a bit with all of the dust accumulated in the bottom. As we were cleaning, we also noticed some long lost things under the bed, like some random notes for school.</p><p>The bed finally finished assembling (I'm very thankful for the worker helping me assembling the bed considering how much work there was to do), and I started to moving back my stuff. I realised how much space there is to place my stuff. There's so many cabinets to place items that I use frequently and not frequently, I can even put my Chigiri merch without piling it on a mountain in my old tiny cabinet.</p><p>Second of all, I have an actual working space now! Back when I wanted to draw, I have to bring out my foldable table and put it in the middle of a room. I originally had two foldable chairs, but both of them broke (there's a weak point caused by a poorly made design). I couldn't bring in some larger chairs, and the stool is very uncomfortable, so I just sat on my bed, which is not very comfortable as well and not good for my back. With a table right under the bed, I could bring in a gaming chair and sit down comfortably.</p><p>One more wonderful thing is the size of the bed frame is very large. The old bed was a bit small, and as a tall person (in Hong Kong at least), my feet can easily touch the other end of the bed frame, and I can't really move my arms freely. Now the bed frame is larger, I am less likely to hit my arm or leg! Sadly, my bed mattress don't grow along with the bed from, I gotta find fillers somehow. I am decapitating a giant plushie to turn it into bed filler.</p><hr><p>Honestly, I feel really bad about my sister who gave away some of her space for me to have my own room. For now, I should start moving my stuff in the other cabinets for her to place her stuff more. I don't deserve this sister ðŸ˜”</p><p class="date">( 28 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
