There's Land Sports Day (Running, throwing sand bags, long jump etc), and Water Sports Day (Swimming), but in my eyes they are both boring, especially if you don't join any events.</p><p>As a non-sporty person, I didn't participate much races (which I somewhat regret now). I used to participate in running the most, running is easy. What matters is that you run fast, which I couldn't. Despite my height, I couldn't use my body well, and I never won a race. There's one time I nearly got first place, but I guess I'm just a little bit behind, and I didn't make it to the finals. The other races I partook often went horribly, I always trip and fall in the middle of the race, man I sure trip a lot when I was younger.</p><p>I don't have much good memories of joining the races, but the experience of not joining any race isn't any better. Because of respect towards the participants or whatever, you are supposed to pay attention to the races. But what is the fun of watching the races when you don't even know the participants? Being little kids with very minimum attention span, it is very difficult to care about the races, especially since Sports Day can last like 8 hours.</p><p>And here's the thing, you are not allowed to just do your own thing here. Not being allowed to use your phone and play card games there is reasonable, but you are not even allowed to do homework or study. Like seriously, Sports Day is so boring, if I have to spend the whole day sitting in a stadium, at least let me do something productive. What's more ridiculous is that despite there being a tuck shop, you aren't supposed to buy stuff there (Though I have seen some students buy food there and not get caught somehow).</p><p>There is one way is survive the boredom, which is chatting with your friends, I mean it'd be weird to not chat when it is a social event. Unfortunately, for those quiet people and outcasts like me, that method is out of reach. So for the majority of Sports Day, I had to spend hours sitting there doing nothing. Like I did sneak in my homework and stuff, but it's still boring.</p><p>While I understand schools want students to respect the art of sports, but forcing those who doesn't like sports to stay in that event only makes them hate sports more. I wish Sports Day can be optional to attend, so that the event will only have the people who genuinely enjoy this event. I'm saying this as a person who would like to partake in a race if I get to join another Sports Day (which might not be possible, I'm a grown adult now u_ù).</p><p class="date">( 15 Aug 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
