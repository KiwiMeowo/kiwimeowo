For the majority of my life, I used earphones to listen to music. Earphones are more portable, and headphones are more expensive. However, since headphones might have higher quality audio and probably more comfortable to wear.</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gxhcty0vo2v99edpeacyy/IMG_3203_20250306.jpg?rlkey=iirpg8es3m2dqnpm7p7weag1q&st=mjquksyq&raw=1"><p>It is quite comfortable to wear, and might be better in terms of silencing outside noises. I couldn't tell if the music has better quality though, my ears might not notice small details, and I often just listen to music from Youtube. I'm trying out different songs to see if I feel different, so maybe there's a song that sound extra banger (Note: As I'm writing this, I'm listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/Hlq2KVSROCk?si=ysEdqF5VnZJfTsQo" target="_blank">Past the Stargazing Season by H△G</a>, and the song feels so great with headphones).</p><p>So today, I decided to take my headphones to school to test it out, and the experience is quite funky. This pair of headphones uses Bluetooth, meaning it doesn't need wires. While Bluetooth connection causes a small delay between input and audio, it shouldn't affect much just listening to music. However, due to my habit of taking my tangled earphones out, I often look into my bag for earphones while I'm already wearing headphones.</p><p>While headphones are larger than earphones, a good thing about headphones is that it is less messy than tangled wires, and you can just hang them on your neck when you don't use it. It feels kinda weird having it constantly brush against my neck and collarbone, but I don't like putting it in my bag, it doesn't have a lot of space.</p><p>What's more interesting is the noise cancelling function. When testing my headphones at home, I didn't notice anything special since my home is quite silent. But when I turned on my headphones at a restaurant, I was shocked that 90% of the ambient noise is gone! Like, wow is this witchcraft?! This will be useful when I can't sleep from whatever noise is disturbing me.</p><p>On the other hand, noise cancelling has a downside for me. When I'm using them in the train, I felt off, as if my surrondings doesn't match how I'm feeling right now...</p><blockquote><p>Motion sickness occurs due to a difference between actual and expected motion. Symptoms commonly include nausea, vomiting, cold sweat, headache, dizziness, tiredness, loss of appetite, and increased salivation<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p></blockquote><p>Oh yea, my motion sickness is very bad, I mentioned that <a href="01-22.html" target="_blank">in a blog in late January</a>. A little detail I didn't mention is that I don't get motion sick in metro trains, not sure why but this did help me from not dying every time I go to school. Back to topic, it seems the line between a smooth train ride and throwing up is the ambient noise. Because the noise cancellation mode removes the wind and train noises, my brain gets very confused, and the familiar feeling of motion sickness comes to me. Luckily, I can easily adjust the noise cancelling mode using the app, and I don't really mind the ambient noises, the sounds I'm annoyed at tend to be louder than the wind (e.g. A human yelling).</p><p>I'll just mess with my headphones for a while, it is still quite new to me. My birthday is coming up, one year older but I still feel like I'm stuck in 2018. I might write a blog about my birthday, so stay tuned, maybe.</p><div class="blogcredit"><h2>Credits/Reference:</h2><ul><li id="1">[1]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li></ul></div><p class="date">( 6 Mar 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
