The part I was looking forward to the most is there is no more meta, all the skills have the same amount of powers. I get to pick whatever I want now, I think I should focus on my legs first, I feel like my legs has become weaker over the years...</p><p>In the days after I got all the skills (not counting the 4 star ones), these are the skills I used:</p><ul><li>Boat Pose (5 targets)</li><li>Bow Pull (5 targets)</li><li>Side Step (3 targets)</li><li>Hinge Pose (3 targets)</li><li>Tricep Kickback(3 targets)</li><li>Plank (1 targets)</li><li>Leg Raise (1 targets)</li><li>Knee-to-Chest (1 targets)</li><li>Back Press (1 targets)</li><li>Chair Pose (1 targets)</li></ul><p>Majority of the skills above makes me feel like I am training my body in someway, and deal high damage to enemies at the same time. There isn't too much difficulty doing Bow Pull, Tricep Kickback, Leg Raise, Knee-to-Chest and Back Press, but most of the time I will need a short break mid way during the skill. While they are easy to do in my definition, it is still very tiring.</p><p>Yogo poses are often times easy to do, they are done in slower speeds instead of quickly like most skills require. However, most people find planks extremely difficult to do, as it requires high core strength. At first, I found it quite difficult and confusing to do, especially since I can't see the screen during the skill. But after I watched a video demonstration, I realised it was very easy for me to do it. I think it is one of my favourite skills to do.</p><p>Side Step isn't as painful as squats, I think it is quite easy to do to a certain degree. But in the context of gaming, it has to be done in the rhythm of the current battle music. And often times, it is either too fast, which makes it hard to catch up, or too slow, making the controllers difficult to register my movement. Either way, it drains a lot of my energy, and TBH it is a good thing.</p><p>And there's planks... God I hate planks. Everyone knows planks are very difficult to do, even maintaining the correct position is hard on its own. But the reason I add it to my skill set is because I want to try getting out of my comfort zone a bit, I use this skill whenever the enemy is close to dying, so that I can only do planks a few times. But there is a few times where I miscalculated the amount of remaining health of the enemy, so I had to do the entire thing almost dying.</p><p>I do not use any healing skills in my set, because I haven't really encountered a scenario where I need healing. Even if I do, I often just use my juice, I have stored up many ingredients after all.</p><p>I have used these skills so many times, I was starting to get bored of them. It is a good thing that the game offers skills of the same power in Master mode.</p><hr><p>After thinking about what skills I should use, I suddenly thought of an idea to make a tierlist on which skills I find easy or hard. So I did!</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hwcdjmvq1n9d43o7eyn80/ringfit_min_20250520.jpg?rlkey=5st1lc4zrgmjm0zr3akdq6r0t&raw=1"><p>Ok looking back I think I should've moved Warrior I pose to the easy category, and put overhead bend and Pendulum Bend to the "Easy but I wanna throw up :(".</p><p>The easy category refers to me not feeling much after doing it, it feels so easy I don't know if it is doing anything to my body, the perfect means it exhausts me but in a good way, the challenging and hell category explains itself. The bottomest ones are the ones I barely tried, I assumed it was because their powers are too low and I never bothered to try them.</p><p>There isn't much things to mention in the easy category, I think the one that uses the most energy is Thigh Press, but I don't think I have ever felt exhausted after finishing the skill. Overhead Hip Shake should've been very easy, it's just shaking your hips left and right. But for some reason, my controller seems to have gotten worse in detecting motion on my legs, it's worse than the detection in Side Step.</p><p>In the perfect section, I think the most interesting ones are squats and chair pose. Like I mentioned, I feel like my legs have gotten weaker, and I am having more trouble doing leg skills, including squats. When I first got back to RingFit, I had a lot of trouble doing squats, my legs and ankles quickly got sore. But as time past, I think I got better in the squat position, and now I can do the squat skill with less breaks.</p><p>In the challenging category, two of the yoga skills require balance. While I used to be fairly good in balancing, I feel like I have gotten worse in it. I used to do Warrior III pose fairly well without problems, but now I can't do it without my body jiggling or falling to one side, I really need to train myself back up. Normal Knee-Lift and Knee-Lift Combo have the same problem with Side Step, I have a hard time following the rhythm when it's fast, the thing that makes Side Step easier is that it is less straining on the knees. Also I placed the Wide Squat here too, I can do normal squats for now, but I'm still having trouble doing Wide Squats.</p><p>Ah yes the unholy trio, Planks, Overhead Squats and Mountain Climber. I have explained why I hate planks just now, but Overhead Squats and Mountain Climber might be worse. I don't know why raising your arms makes squatting so much harder, but it exhausts me after like five reps. And it is so common in boss fights, like how do you expect me to keep that pose for over 30 seconds?? When I have to do that during boss fights, I often just cheat by sitting on a chair. And Mountain Climber is just impossible, not only is it hard to do, the controller is also very bad at detecting the leg movement, achieving full perfect in this skill might be impossible.</p><hr><p>I can't think of a conclusion, let's just say the final boss should've cut into sections (had to play almost an entire hour), and how tf do you do Mountain Climber???</p><p class="date">( 20 May 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
