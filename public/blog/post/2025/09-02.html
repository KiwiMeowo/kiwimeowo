Though the work time is longer, the work place is a bit closer to my home. As a result, I don't have much time to do my own thing during transport time, and I spent a lot of my free time doing Art Fight stuff in July. Before internship, I used to play a lot of Good Pizza, Great Pizza during train times and leisure times, but with time contraints (and burn out from the game), I hadn't touched it for a long time.</p><p>So school started, like title mentioned. With me spending so much time in the office, it seems I am not very used to university anymore, since I completely forgot how long it takes for the train to arrive to the destination. While the train takes a blink of an eye to arrive to the station near my work place, it takes over 30 minutes to arrive to the train station near my school. On the first day of school, I simply listened to songs, thinking that was enough to keep me entertained just like the times during internship... After like three songs, I was like "wow it sure is taking a lot of time to take me there..." I realised I also had to play games to spend the long time in the train back then.</p><p>After months of not playing Good Pizza, Great Pizza, I might have missed a few limited toppings, but currently there is apple toppings. There's 15 days left, so maybe I have time to get the permanent toppings in time (or I can just use crystals). Anyways, while I am still a bit pissed about being scolded by customers when I'm just trying to relax playing this game, it is a very good game to spend leisure time.</p><p>Also I have underestimated how crowded the trains can be when students have to go to school as well. During internship, while it can be crowded sometimes, it was somewhat acceptable, and I can get off the train quite soon. However, if I have to go to school in early morning, I would be stuffed into the train with many passengers like sardines. And the queues to the train take so long to move, I actually got a bit late to class. Well I gotta be careful next time!</p><p class="date">( 2 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../../comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="../../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
