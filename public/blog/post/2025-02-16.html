While we both enjoy co-op games, I'm a bit hesitant about playing a game about divorce. It isn't a sensitive topic to me, but I have yet to find a story with this topic that isn't frustrating/infuriating to go through. Anyways we started playing anyways... til we found out we need at least another pair of switch controllers to play this game. But we managed to order a new pair, and we started playing for real.</p><p>So the story is about May and Cody's relationship failing to the brink of divorce, and Rose, the child who doesn't want their parents to be divorced, makes two dolls and wishes them to get along again. After Rose's tears fell onto the dolls, the couple became the dolls. And Dr Harvey, which takes form as the Book of Love, <s>forces</s> guides them to heal their relationship.</p><hr><h2>Thoughts</h2><p>Gameplay wise, it is a fanstatic game. There is such a wide variety of mechanics, every chapter your character has different abilities that feels quite wonderful to use. And there are many sections with interesting gameplay, <span class="spoiler">One part I found very funny is when May fights a squirrel on a plane, fighter game style.</span> I'd say May's abilities are more fun to use, it's always weirdly violent. <span class="spoiler">The most memorable part is the last chapter, as I thought her ability is just singing... Until I pressed ZL+ZR and she blasts a gust of energy [A!!!].</span> Aside from the main gameplay, there are other minigames we can play, like whack-a-mole, skate-racing, and even chess.</p><p>The visuals are fantastic as well. <span class="spoiler">My favourite map is snow mountain place (idk what it's called). The place is based off a snow globe in their house, and when you are playing in the map, if you look closely at the sky, you'll notice there's something in the sky. Look closer, you'll notice the outside of the sky is the interior of the house. I also really like the clock tower map, the space map, I don't remember the details, but there are so many stuff that we found amazing.</span> The maps are beautiful and detailed, both me and my sister are amazed every chapter.</p><p>I'll not comment much story-wise, because we skipped A LOT of cutscenes. Dr Harvey is supposed to fix the couple's relationship, but me, my sister, and the couple certainly found that damned book annoying. His dramatic and cocky attitude makes the story less enjoyable, one second of hearing him makes us more annoyed. Fortunately, there's a skip button, and what's interesting about the skip button is It Takes Two players to skip the cutscene! It's always funny whenever the book appears, and I'll see my sister holding the skip button already.</p><p>However, we still know about the elephant scene... yes that one. <span class="spoiler">It's pretty absurd the couple's idea of breaking the curse of being a doll is to make their daughter cry again, and even if that's the solution (which it isn't), they are strangely not very against making their child sad. The murder of Cutie (Rose's favourite toy) is such a horrifying scene, perhaps more disturbing than many of the stories I've seen more in my life. It is not even self-defense like the previous enemies, this time it's just murdering an innocent being, and the worst of all is the plan of breaking the spell didn't work! When Rose cried after seeing Cutie broke, the couple went to shower under her tears, but the spell didn't break, Cutie died for nothing!</span> That scene is extremely sad, but I mean it as an compliment.</p><p>The story sure has it's charming moments, but we felt like the ending wasn't very fulfilling. <span class="spoiler">During the ending, May has to go on stage to sing. I was expecting to be similar to one of the events of Sky:COTL, where the player performs with a character in skate-dancing. However, the singing isn't part of the gameplay, but the kiss is. Also, we skipped the singing cutscene as because we didn't know the performance is in that cutscene. So when we got jumped to the kiss part, we got very confused.</span></p><p>After a bit of searching, it turns out there's an <a href="https://youtu.be/si0hUWSivWo?si=48m2uGgKp22iRsKC" target="_blank">scrapped chapter</a>, focusing on Rose's perspective of the couple's crumbling marriage. <span class="spoiler">I really like the horror aspects, it really captures the feeling of a child witnessing their parents arguing. I also really like the book is exposed as a fraud, I knew he isn't to be trusted! But does it makes the ending better? Not very much. This ending will make the player feel empty, knowing all the effort is for nothing, and then "Oh right we need to stop only caring for ourselves" and the couple came back to normal. I'm not a fan of the kiss scene, but this ending is a bit better than the scrapped one.</span></p><p><span class="spoiler">People say it is open-ended whether Cody and May end up together again, though the kiss scene kinda imply they will go back together again? However, I don't think they should get back together just because they have good synergy or something, they have so many issues together, like money, time-management, common relationship problems. They might be together for now, but what happens if they end up in the same obstacle, argue about divorce again?</span> It's gonna Take more than Two to fix a broken relationship, a extra person called marriage counsellor. And sometimes, divorce might be better for the couple and the child, the children might end up more traumatised seeing their parents argue over and over again rather than them being separated. @nopenopenopesomuchnope4137 from the comment section of <a href="https://youtu.be/8_Hm5Jr188s?si=OP9TUqkvn7GZhgUh" target="_blank">RT's gameplay</a> kinda sums up how I feel.</p><blockquote><p><span class="spoiler">Honestly, this game has a pretty awful message at the core of it. Yes, couples therapy can work for couples that are having issues with each other, but it's a slow process, it doesn't just take an afternoon to sort out months or even years of problems. But sometimes, it doesn't work and the couple is better off seperate then desperately trying to patch up a marrige that doesn't work. But that fucking book basically put a gun to our character's heads and said "make up or else I'll kill you with my death traps." Honestly, I'd give Cody and May a few weeks before their issues start popping up again. They only got back together because they literally had no choice or else they would die/stay comatose forever.</span></p><p><span class="spoiler">The only good message is at the end where the parents say it's not Rose's fault for the divorce, because that can be hard for kids to grasp that their mom and dad just don't get along like they used to. Cody and May are better off as just friends with joint guardianship rather than trying desperately to fix their marrige.</span></p></blockquote><p>I wish everyone to be in a healthy, functioning family, it sucks to have messily-divorced parents...</p><p>Oh wait the conclusion. If you have another friend/partner/family member who's willing to play co-op games, I'd absolutely recommend this game, it's really fun and colorful, you'd never feel bored playing this game. It's up to you whether to skip the story though, the book is a bit difficult to endure.</p><center><ul><li>Gameplay: ★★★★★<span style="text-shadow:0 0 7px #00a2ff">★</span></li><li>Visual: ★★★★★</li><li>Story: ★★☆☆☆</li></ul></center></div><p class="date">( 16 Feb 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../e.js"></script><script src="../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
