I used to want a lot of toys, stationeries, and whatever stuff I found fun. But now, I don't really know what I want for Christmas or my next birthday presents, perhaps I have already gotten all the stuff I want, or I just lost interest in too many things? Though there is something I rarely get bored of, which is food.</p><p>When I was young, the things I spent the most on are snacks. During recess, I always rush down stairs to get my favourite food from the canteen, like the chicken fingers from my secondary school or the ham omelette from my primary school. If they got sold out, I might buy other tasty snacks, like shui mai or candies.</p><p>It was quite difficult for me to not eat anything tasty in my free time even if I'm ill. One time I wanted to buy a pack of candies while I was having a small flu, the vendor, noticing the mask over my mouth, asked if I am sure I can eat the candies. I told her "Uh I am going to save these for after I am healed", and of course I lied and ate the candies soon after buying them.</p><p>When I was going through puberty, I noticed my appetite increased a lot. A bit context for my primary school is that you can order lunch boxes for the month, and you can refill the rice and sauce for free. When I was like 5-6th grade, it is almost certain that I will go refill my lunch box (TBH there's not very much food for a growing kid). I noticed those who refill their lunchboxes only fill like a quarter, or at most half, of the lunch box. But for me I'm pretty sure multiple times I asked to fully fill up my lunch box with rice.</p><p>The lunch boxes can be quite tasty not gonna lie, which might be a hot take in my classroom. My classmates always hated how the lunch boxes taste, and after that one time some students got food poisoning from it, they all openly expressed their hatred of the food towards the people who deliever food to our classrooms.</p><p>While yes, sometimes the food can be gross (like the ones with mushrooms), I always like it when there's sauce with rice. My favourite combination is white sauce with rice, I think I'm just a fan of rice with sauce. During puberty, I enjoyed eating rice with sauce so much I sometimes eat too fast and, I choke. Like I can breathe, but it did not go down, not dangerous (maybe) but painful. I needed to drink water, slowly down and let the food go down. It happened so many times during primary school, but never happened again after I graduated, for some reason.</p><p>During secondary school, 7th grade students aren't allowed to dine outside yet, so we either bring our lunch boxes or order the ones at school, I'm the former one. I wasn't a big fan of this, because overnight veggies tend to become too soggy, especially when it is heated up again. So thank god we are allowed to go out the next year.</p><p>Sadly, there isn't much restaurants near my school, and it takes too long to go to the nearest shopping mall. While the nearest restaurants aren't bad, it's just sometimes the queue is very long, as I am not the only student who needs to eat. Also, I am bound to become bored of the food. So one of my other options is to either go home (which is very close to my home) and eat food there, or buy some chips and eat alone in a park. The first option is more relaxing, I can just lay on my bed and nap for a while. The second option... While it is nice to hear birds chriping and feel the wind, it feels very empty, maybe eating just chips and sandwiches isn't enough lmao.</p><p>Having chips for lunch is a questionable choice, but the next thing I'm gonna write is probably worse. My sweet tooth got very bad when I was in secondary school, was it my deteriorating mental health that makes me use sugary stuff to hold on to my sanity, or was it just me realising I can buy whatever I want with the money I've saved? The answer is lost to time, but what I know is I was obsessed with Kinder Bueno White Chocolate Bar during 9-ish grade. There are days I eat two packs in one sitting (there are two chocolate bars in one pack), but there are times I eat three packs in one setting, which then I started to become concerned, "Is this bad for my health?".</p><p>Thankfully, my sweet tooth isn't as bad now, though I often find myself crave very sweet chocolate even now and then.</p></div><p class="date">( 27 Dec 2024 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../e.js"></script><script src="../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
