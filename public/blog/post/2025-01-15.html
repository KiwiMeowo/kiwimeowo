However, if we consider this in universe, who named them and how are they named?</p><p>I got this question years ago, when I was listening to a video about how to create an OC, and I heard someone say it is strange to name a character based off their story, because how could the person naming them know about their future? Like how would the parents of Hunter know their child is going to become a hunter when they grow up? I thought of a few possibilities, like the parents were training the child to be a hunter, or maybe weird destiny stuff lead them to be a hunter, or the child likes being a hunter so much they changed their name (?), or maybeee the OC writer just likes to not think about it too hard.</p><p>While there can be many answers for that, the question reminded me that the reason I gave them the name and the in universe origin of their names might not be the same. So I started to wonder, how did my OCs get their names in their story?</p><p>I feel like Grey is named this way because his color scheme is grey. I think it is somewhat rare for someone to have a greyscale color scheme in the Stardust Isle, cuz magic essence should be colorful.</p><p>I would assume the caretaker of Lavender just likes flowers really much, and whenever I imagine Lavender's past and think about the people she used to live with, they would probably be named after flowers as well.</p><p>Being named after their magic elements should be the most common, Solar is the main example (and the only example, for some reason). I mean having light element is somewhat powerful in this world.</p><p>For Wolf, I have already mentioned the origin. I named him that cuz wolves tend to work with ravens. And in universe, he also know about this fact and he wants to be buddies with Raven, and the name Wolf is cool (and I think he might be a furry). As for Raven.... I'm not so sure, maybe his color scheme is dark, and his caretakers expect him to be clever like a raven? Well he did grow up to be quite intelligent, considering he's a scientist or some sort.</p><p>Jaspers' case is quite interesting, because his name is somewhat randomly given, and I also decided to keep his childhood story hidden away, because it isn't exactly relevant to the main story, and not everything has to be explained. But that means neither him and the story will know why is he named after a gemstone. At least Claire would think his name is cool, cuz she likes gemstones.</p><p>I feel like Cosmos' is perhaps the most important. I'll have to explain a bit of her backstory. She has been on this land since this land is born, but for many years, she's only been referred to as the Cometling. After years of being forgotten, she met someone, a lost traveller on a quest to save her friend, and that is the person who gave her the name Cosmos.</p><center>"Cometling just feels like a name for a species... Don't you want a new name, for your beginning to a new life?"<br>"You know, your powers really remind me of the glimmering stars in the sky, my friend really loved them..."<br>"There's a word that I always found cool... Cosmos... Do you like this name?"</center><p>That's somewhat of a major lore drop considering how stubborn I was in terms of giving out spoilery stuff, but I mean I haven't come up with anything new about the lore-building, and I don't wanna starve you guys lol.</p></div><p class="date">( 15 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></div><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="../../comment-widget.js"></script></div></div><script src="../../e.js"></script><script src="../../spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
