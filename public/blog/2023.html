        <div class="content">
        <h1>This is certainly a way to end the year</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>I really wanted to write a post to end the year of 2023, so this is the topic. In 2023, characters that managed to become my blorbos are Chigiri Hyoma ("Bring so much Positive Vibes" Award), Barou Shouei (Best Character Developement Award), Prune Juice Cookie (Best Twink Award), Gim Cookie (Silly Award), and of course Golden Cheese Cookie (Best Story Award).</p>
          <p>Those above are from media I really enjoy. However, I will also be including my OCs. Welcome! <a href="/oc/Cosmos.html" target="_blank">Cosmos</a>, <a href="/oc/missing.html#jaspers" target="_blank">Jaspers</a>, you two are part of Blorbo of the Year! I have never thought that random characters made in my head would give me so much will to live.</p>
          <p>I have something to confess: Pome has been the absolute top fav for like, 4 years, there were moments that she nearly lost her spot, but she remained standing at the very top. But, ever since I got into Blue Lock, I had the feeling that this year, the first place will be claimed by someone else. It took me a lot of effort to comprehend the new favourite blorbo of the year, especially being a Pome fan is kinda my identity for a while. After months of identity crisis, today, I think I'm ready to announce the new winner:</p>
	        </div>
	        <center>
	        <h1>Best Blorbo of the Year</h1>
	        <h2>♥ Cosmos ♥</h2>
	        <p></p>
	        <h1>Best non-OC Blorbo of the Year</h1>
	        <h2>♥ Barou Shouei ♥</h2>
	        </center>
	        <div class="text">
	        <p>Man it feels weird not having Pome at the top. I still love Pome a lot tho <s>Pls don't kill me Pome</s>. Next year, I hope Pome and other characters I love will get more content. Here's the rest of the rankings.</p>
	        <ul>
	        <h3><p>3. Hollyberry Cookie</p>
	        <p>4. Golden Cheese Cookie</p>
	        <p>5. Chigiri Hyoma</p>
	        <p>6. Pomegranate Cookie</p>
	        <p>7. Gim Cookie</p>
	        <p>8. Jaspers</p>
	        <p>9. Prune Juice Cookie</p>
	        <p>10. Timekeeper Cookie</p></h3>
	        </ul>
	        <p>This result may be quite hard to take in <span style="font-size:0.66em">I don't think people actually care about this lol</span>, but next year, the results may be even weirder and unusual. Stay tuned, and prepare for anything the years may throw at us!</p>

        <button class="collapsible" title="Vent">Stupidly Traumatic Camp: The Balloon <span class="blogdate">( 19 Dec 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>It's not that serious lol</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>When I was almost graduating primary school, our class got a "fun" indoors camp. I really enjoy indoors camping, like sleepover with your friends. However, it is more like training, the teachers were strict as fuck, you have to stand for hours while being yelled at- why the fuck would teachers decide this is a good idea?! I think the best thing that happened there is that I held my crush's hand, but another event that is equally memorable is something related to balloons.</p>
          <p>As we were kids, it is important to have some activities that teach you some lessons. That time, teachers gave us each a balloon, I got a gold one if I remember correctly. Then the teachers told us imagine everything and everyone that we love and put them inside the balloon, not hard to do so because I really liked my balloon. The room was quiet, other classmates were doing the same thing while the teachers talked in a small voice...</p>
          <i>POP</i>
          <p>The sudden noise scared us. What's going on? The room suddenly fell into chaos, teachers are attacking the students' previous ballons out of nowhere. My brain realised that, yet my body couldn't react fast. Then <i>POP</i>, a teacher got to my balloon, then the poor thing's life got cut short. It was just sitting peacefully in my lap, now it became sad shards of plastic.</p>
          <p>Some of the balloons survived from being thrown far away by their cautious owners, but most of them perished. Apparently, teachers wanted to teach us a lesson that nothing in our life lasts forever, even our most beloved ones. Blah blah blah something something life is short...</p>
          <p>My brain could not really absorb any of that. I was still staring at the remains of my balloon, still having a hard time understanding the situation. Why did they do that? Why couldn't I protect my balloon? If only I acted faster, if only I moved a little bit more and covered my balloon with my body, I could've protected it! I did not cry, but it felt more painful than all the other losses I had before. </p>
          <p>I decided to tie the ballon shards onto my watch, so that it could stay with me. My other classmates probably had gotten over it, and told me to not do that since it's kinda a trash now, I didn't listen. For the remainer of the camp, the balloon was on my wrist, until I probably threw it away when I got home.</p>
          <p>It took a while for this memory to resurface, and I'm certain this has worsened my paranoia of being hurt again. I worry that one day, if me or my loved ones get threatened, I couldn't do anything, just like how I couldn't react to protect my balloon. I wish that, if I ever get bullied or in danger, I could at least bite back. Even if I die or get injured more, I would at least not feel guilt or shame, I would still have my dignity. Sometimes I feel like I should bring a weapon with me, just in case, but I would look more suspicious, I don't wanna attract police.</p>
          <p>I feel kinda bad how the "death" of a balloon impacted me more than the actual deaths that happened to lives near me, but it is how it is. Anyways yesterday I remembered a OC setting I made in 2018, and a character which is based of a balloon dog (Penelope), mentioned in the blog post below. Maybe I could base her off the balloon, to deal with this horrible memory.</p>
          <p>Maybe I'm just too sensitive idk</p>

        <button class="collapsible" title="OC">That edgy phase I didn't have <span class="blogdate">( 17 Dec 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>So it came to me late</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>Everyone has that one phase where they are super edgy and into evil things, well I didn't, at least the phase is so minuscule it doesn't mean much if I pointed it out. I did have a few drawings of <a href="/oc/Kyrea.html" target="_blank">Kyrea</a> having red eyes and a knife, but after that, I don't have much drawings being edgy. No I'm not showing it-</p>
          <p>The closest 'edgy' phase I had is probably after I graduated secondary school, which is also the time I started working on my story Upon the Starry Sky. Without the burden of studying for DSE, I have more energy in enjoying different media, including listening to songs. The songs I enjoy makes me rotate my OCs in my head faster, imagine all the things and tragedy that can happen to them! And also, I really enjoy the concept of being a villain and stuff, not giving a fuck about what other think about you, you just vibin, dancin and be a menace to humanity. This is more of a 'villain' phase than 'edgy' phase... Anyway, this topic is inspired by a Youtube video talking about evil counterparts, you will understand in a minute.</p>
          <p>If you read my other blogs, you've probably seen one about <a href="/oc/Cosmos.html" target="_blank">Cosmos</a>, one for <a href="/oc/Lav.html" target="_blank">Lavender</a> and one for Kyrea (in the 8th anni post). If you see the group photo in the main page, you'll notice the buff dude <a href="/oc/missing.html#jaspers" target="_blank">Jaspers</a> hasn't got his, well here it is! I'ma keep this discreet because I don't know when I will find this post so cringe I want to wipe this from everyone's memory.</p>
          <p>In the early stages of worldbuilding, since Cosmos is supposed to be the leader (or vice-leader) of a guild, I decided I should stop imaging Cosmos being alone in the void and dead inside, I made several winged friends in<u> 28 September, 2022</u>.</p>
	        </div>
	        <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/oc1ljdmtewmjqg71khg8o/Photo-17-12-2023-9-00-31-PM.jpg?rlkey=ng35w0nvviwjxflw2a1xwqszo&amp;raw=1"><center>First appearance of Jaspers, Bun, Penelope and Raven</center>
	        <center style="font-size:0.66em">Wait who are those two-</center>
	        <div class="text">
	        <p>Familiar faces! You probably recognise Bun and Jaspers. Those other two, however, isn't revealed yet and will be a part of the story in a different way. There was many ideas for this winged human clan, but I dropped it due to worldbuilding issues (too unnecessarily complex). But I had quite a lot of fun thinking about them, don't worry some of the ideas are adjusted and are still relevant.</p>
	        <p>OK back to Jaspers. At that time, I was in love with the idea of friendly rivals, it doesn't have to be romantic, and it always makes me so happy. As someone who likes Cosmos a little too much, I decided to make a rival for her. And yup, it's Jaspers. Unlike Cosmos, whose whole personality revolves being friendly and passionate, Jaspers is more distant and tad bit scary-looking. However, in the settings, these two are equally strong, and the hot-headed Cosmos always see him as someone to compete against.</p>
	        </div>
	        <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jbjaey9fc604rd7vwcmqc/Photo-17-12-2023-9-18-12-PM.jpg?rlkey=y3ngzd3647anq4f1clx8zs079&amp;raw=1"><center>Cosmos being mad she's shorter. BTW for the time being, Jaspers is the tallest character</center>
	        <div class="text">
	        <p>There's not much ideas about Jaspers, but one main idea for him is that he might be some sort of anti-hero/villain (finally Kiwi you are back on topic). Cosmos was the bright hero, while Jaspers is a villain fighting his way, and I probably imagined them having some epic fight scene. </p>
	        <i>"Despite how hard he tired, he couldn't escape his tragic fate. In his final moments, he saw a light, power floods into his body. That's when he decided, he will not let things end here."</i>
	        <i>"He will rise up, and get back what he rightfully owns."</i>
	        <p>I enjoy thinking about him when listening to villain-like songs, and I swear one of inspirations for Jaspers originated from <a href="https://youtu.be/e1Ik4LTLizE?si=xFfGhwipNg0VFVEI" target="_blank">Misery Loves Company by VocaCircus</a>. Other than that, I also like thinking about story ideas listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/4rX5a3bnG4s?si=gFh3Gw-DwmUU1irN" target="_blank">Laplace's Angel by Will Wood</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/KpKXx6t-XGo?si=asIpijn79NdGptZi" target="_blank">this version of Red Moon</a> and prob more that I don't remember. It is hard to imagine him making a evil grin though, not because he can't, it's just it would feel too over-the-top edgy.</p>
	        <p>For the time being, his character isn't very fleshed out, but neither is Cosmos when I first created her. Her only personality used to be just being a great leader and stuff, now she has more depth and struggles. One day, maybe next year, Jaspers will become a character that I can show proudly to my viewers and friends. OK now lemme get back and rotate him in my head while listening to songs.</p>

        <div class="content">
        <h1>How I wonder why is it single star</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>As a kid, I was obsessed with stars, pretty sure liking stars was part of my personality. Anyways that isn't really relevant, what I wanted to say is that at one point, I found out there's something off about the lyrics of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
          <i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
How I wonder what you are!<br>
Up above the world so high,<br>
Like a diamond in the sky.<br>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
How I wonder what you are!
          </i></ul>
          <div class="text">
          <p>This song is often associated with a night sky full of shiny stars. However, in the lyrics, it seems to only talk about a <i>single</i> star, and not multiple stars. "Why did nobody whatsoever point this out?" I thought, but I honestly doubt many people would put too much thought in a song for kids, they would probably say something like,"Oh the lyrics wouldn't rhyme if the stars are plural." and end the case. But as someone with too much time in her hands, I must get to the bottom of this.</p>
          <p>For a while, I wondered which star was the song referring to. There are so many stars in the universe, it would be very difficult to guess. However I noticed something,<u> the lyrics never specified if the time is day or night.</u> Perhaps... the star in this song is reffering to the<u> sun?</u></p>
          <p>Well this theory is quickly debunked. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinkle,_Twinkle,_Little_Star" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, in the original poem, it is specified that the sun has gone down, and the sky is dark.</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
          <i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
How I wonder what you are!<br>
Up above the world so high,<br>
Like a diamond in the sky.<br>
<br>
When the blazing sun is gone,<br>
When he nothing shines upon,<br>
Then you show your little light,<br>
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br>
<br>
Then the trav'ller in the dark,<br>
Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br>
He could not see which way to go<br>
If you did not twinkle so.<br>
<br>
In the dark blue sky you keep,<br>
And often thro' my curtains peep,<br>
For you never shut your eye,<br>
Till the sun is in the sky.<br>
<br>
'Tis your bright and tiny spark,<br>
Lights the trav'ller in the dark,<br>
Tho' I know not what you are,<br>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
</i>
</ul>
<div class="text">
<p>Today, I finally learnt that in the original poem, the star saved a traveller from getting lost. However, it seems the point of this poem is that we don't know what star it is, and the only thing we know about it is that it shines brightly. I mean, hasn't the author stated from right from the beginning and ending that she doesn't know what it is? Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are...</p>

        <div class="content">
        <h1>I actually want to share my drawings...</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>Since a certain age, I became very insecure about my interests (likely due to being mocked a lot), I refused to let anyone see my drawings. Whenever someone comes near while I'm drawing, I will immediately stop what I'm doing and hide my pictures. This habit also occurs if that person is my sister, although she never judged my art, she isn't as into art as me, and when I feel someone's enthusiasm couldn't catch up with me, I kinda just feel it's not a good conversation anyway. The only time I'm able to share my drawings is posting through the internet, and sometimes where I post can be viewed by people I know IRL, but it feels less stressful, I just hope they never bring it up when talking to me.</p>
          <p>Recently I started rollerskating, I'm quite proud for myself for being able to go in different directions without falling now. One thing I would wish to change is where I play. There is not much places to play such activities, especially since I'm still not very confident in this skill yet, I don't want to fall onto any people on the street. I often go to the nearby football playground, which of course, has other people playing football or doing other sports. This should not be a big problem if there's enough space for me... except it is. The insecurity mentioned above still affects me here, if I am rollerskating with any human presence around, I quickly feel uncomfortable, even when they aren't looking at me. This kinda makes me less motivated to go outside and play, oh I wish I have somewhere private to play, not my home though, it's too small.</p>

        <center>The optimal DSE experience</center>
          <div class="text">
          <p>In Hong Kong, there's a university entrance exam called DSE, which majority of the students graduating from secondary school will take. I have taken this exam in 2022, unlike some people who studied until they get sick and are sent to hospital, I kinda... slacked off.</p>
          <p>As you may know from previous blogs, I was not in a great state during secondary school, it would make sense I wouldn't study that well. Aside from that, I was called by some as "gifted", I learn stuff very quickly. The drawbck is that I never learnt how to study, almost all the exams and tests, I winged it. Well at least I passed all of them. People<u> REALLY </u>cared about DSE, it decides which university you go to after all, hence the studied so hard you get sick part. I often felt like I didn't put enough effort after seeing all the examples of people sacrificing their health for DSE, even though I was trying my best. The grades I have isn't the best I could have, and the university I'm in isn't exactly the top ones, but honestly, there ain't much I regret, I tried my best, that's all.</p>
          <p>But this might be interesting to non-Hong Kongers, so I'll briefly explain. There are four core subjects, Chinese, English, Math and Liberal Studies, which Chinese and English are divided into four parts, reading, listening, writing and speaking (both speaking exams are cancelled in my year due to COVID19). Students might also have to take other exams depending what subjects they have also taken at school, examples are physics, biology, chemistry, history and more. Some of the subjects may or may not be availible at school, like Physical Education, I believe it is quite rare, never heard from anyone who taken this exam. Anyways, I took<u> Visual Arts </u>and<u> Information and Computer Technology</u>, jarring isn't it?</p>
          <p>Ok back to DSE, the most memorable part of this is the Listening exams. From primary school and pre-DSE secondary school, the audio was played on the classroom's speaker. But in the final stages of preparation, I was shocked to know the audio for DSE is played on a radio!?!?? My exam venue required us to bring the right headphones, but I heard some venues need you to bring your own radio, scary... During the exam, the static noises from the radio is so strong, it was quite disturbing, and with Greensleeves playing before each questions, it certainly hit different.</p>
          <p>This is a confession about my VA exam. In this exam, there are part A and part B, part B is a list of themes or ideas, you have to paint or create something based of it. I struggled to pick questions 1-3, and I don't think the painting I did fully matched the theme I picked. After the exam, when I was discussing with my friend, I only knew that there was like three more questions to pick. If my art teacher is seeing this now, pls dont kill me.</p>
          <p>There are levels 1-5 in DSE grades, and if you are very good, you might get 5* or even 5** (Some people might refer achieving these two grades as picking stars. Hey this is where I get my idea of my OC team name from!). I got level 3 for most subjects, and level 2 for math, I sure passed all of them. English, of course, has the highest level, which is level 4...<u><i> BUT HOLD ON!</i></u> If you check the individual exams,<u> I GOT 5* IN THE READING EXAM!!! I GOT A FUCKING STAR!!!!11!!1</u>, unfortunately, it got pulled down by writing exam, smh. To those took the exams, good work owob. And to those preparing for the exam, good luck and uhhh, reach for the stars!</p>

        <h1>Wow what tf happened to me in 2017</h1>
        <i><center>Depression and mental health issues mentioned, proceed with caution</center></i>
          <div class="text">
          <p>This is somewhat related to the last post, something something about missing my childhood.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure exactly how or why my personality changed so drastically. On the internet, I used to be quite expressive and more 'extroverted', unafraid to interact with people. Ok maybe I know why I changed, there are several bad internet friendships that hurted me a lot, but that change is quite big.</p>
          <p>Aside from that and my parents' divorce, I barely started secondary school. I had to go to cram school like 3 days a week, and as someone who<i><u> hated </u></i>studying, it was quite unbearable. One day after cram school, as I was going home at evening, the brain mechanism that blocked my trauma from the bullying suddenly disappeared, and I finally realised my primary school memories had been filtered by rosy glasses. After that, I kinda went into a state of depression, and my brain was constantly under a big fog. Something strange happened though, being a misfit at school and being dead inside, my mind seemed to have created a imaginary friend, who is also myself. 'I' complained why my life has ended up like this, and mocked me for all the things that happened. Sounds toxic af but that was the only close friend that I had, and I didn't know what is "treating your friends kindly", so that became my motivation to live on somehow. This friend filled my social needs, despite this not being that effective.</p>
          <p>For the entirety of secondary school, it felt like a dream. There might be hardships or happy experiences, but mostly they didn't feel real. Well except for the times that I had my very great friend with nice vibes who studied visual arts with me (°◡°♡), still loved the time when we went to an art museum during chrismas. My mental state was still awful though, there were a few times I just sat down on a bench for an hour after school, because I don't want to follow my routine of school anymore.</p>
          <p>Thanks to consulation, my mental state improved greatly, I processed my trauma healthier instead of blaming myself for everything. And the imaginary friend in my head also treated me more kindly, and she kinda divided into multiple personalities (y'know, my OCs in my index page), well I always got more room for new friends. At some point, I became sick of my brain fog which was protecting me from more stress, "I want to express myself, I want to feel alive!", that's what I said. I started to rebuild my story of Yume and Mira, also currently Upon the Starry Sky. It took me a while to get out of the fog, but now I'm not dead inside, but dying from school anxiety, which is way better!</p>
          <p>I have changed myself so much, giving up right now seems like a shame. I'm glad I survived childhood, because this stage really sucked, having no freedom of choice, being neglected... I don't have much good advice since not everyone can apply the same rules, but if I have to say one, it is not your fault being hurt during childhood.</p>

        <h1>Bullying and mental health issues mentioned, proceed with caution</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>I tend to look back in my childhood, just like those sad adults. My childhood is full of trauma, but for two years, it was the best part of my life. People always tell me to stop looking back and move forward, but no matter how much I grow, I always feel the current happiness isn't as great as before.</p>
          <p>To summarise that two years, I met a really great friend, my classmates stopped bullying me, I felt like spending time with said friend was my motivation to live on. But after that year, despite being in a better environment (by better I mean being disliked but not directly being picked on), I felt extremely depressed and had to deal with the trauma caused by my old school. For so long, I wished to meet my old friend again, even though I am too afraid to ask.</p>
          <p>I don't want to be ungrateful. I had a lot of great changes and growth, I improved my art skills, I made online friends that I cared about. I became less depressed and more optimistic about the future, but I often wished I can be as happy as those years, and I would give up my current life to go back in time. If most people see this, they may encourage me to move on from this experience, but it is difficult when the events that happen to me tend to disappoint me. Unlike what people say about secondary school/high school or university, I don't feel less lonely, and the sense of dread seems to keep growing. What's the point of life if this awful feeling just grows and grows?</p>
          <p>In the current life, what keeps me going is my OCs, my friends and the silly art I have. I may still feel empty inside, but for now I don't want to give up yet. If life hates me, I will stay alive just to spite it.</p>

      <button class="collapsible" title="OC">Kiwi's Q&amp;A <span class="blogdate">( 11 Nov 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>Literally no one asked for this but I'm lonely as fuck</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>The following questions are all made up by myself, I only imagined someone asking me this. I mean who knows, maybe the person reading this have thought of this question.</p>
          <h2>How did you come up with the story "Upon the Starry Sky"?</h2>
          <p>When creating OCs, I often felt obligated to give them a story, or else they wouldn't live up to their potential (they would also be boring without one). Perhaps being influenced by all the magical kids anime (especially Jewelpet), the story I create tend to revolve around magic. When Lavender (or Yume) and Mira were born from my dream in 2018, I imagined that Yume was some sort of guardian to a magical land, where she had to lead Mira the human back to her home. Moreover, the background is based off a story I wrote as a kid, where I'm a magical girl and I beat up bad guys and stuff. It was meant to be some sort of bittersweet friendship (or romance IDK), but the story wasn't that fleshed out. My bad habit is I often focus too hard on the character I like the most, and neglect the other important details. Eventually, I ran out of ideas, got bored and stopped creating original stuff for a while.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to 2021, when I created Cosmos, I of course have to give a backstory for her, I don't want to imagine her being all alone in the dark. Initially, she was a member of a powerful guild, and she would meet a young child who will become her apprentice. But after some brainstorming, I realised: why not put Lavender and Cosmos in the same universe? When they first merged, the place Cosmos lived was outside of Lavender's land, an entirely different planet. Cosmos was some sort of anti-hero scientist, living in a world where animals became humans with wings due to an angel fucking things up. I forgot exactly how this story changed into the current storyline, but you now know Cosmos is the only animal-human with wings, and Lavender is... who is she exactly though?</p>
          <h2>Why are there so many female OCs here?</h2>
          <p>I feel like it maybe because I'm a girl, but not too sure about this phenomenon. What I can be sure is there is at least three more male characters I mostly likely will add. Oh and two non-binary characters.</p>
          <h2>When will you update the character pages without refs/art?</h2>
          <p>I will, some time later. I'm a bit too lazy to draw refs at the time being. Also, I messed up a little with the settings, now I have to be careful with one of the designs or else there will be story spoilers.</p>
          <h2>Will Kyrea ever be part of the story? She seems important to you</h2>
          <p>Oh lol literally no one knows that Kyrea is important to me. Anyways, I do not plan on adding her into the story, because I don't think she would provide much to the plot. However, I did imagine what abilities she would have in this world. She would wish to have something that can help her fly, however, I believe she would actually have the magic type of Energy: Earthquake. </p>
          <h2>What are your OCs favourite foods?</h2>
          <p>I don't think of this question much, so I'll just wing it. Cosmos probably enjoys beef jerky, I mean it's very tasty. Lavender might like sweet food, maybe she likes eating cookies. Considering Grey gets sick easily (wait did I ever mention that?), he might enjoy snacks like potato chips, just because he doesn't get to eat them much. Ruth being raised in the woods, I imagine her enjoying berries and fruits. Claire definitely likes candies a lot, because they look a lot like gems. I think Solar likes borscht and the beef in the soup (something I just learnt, borscht originated from Ukraine, and it is very different from Hong Kong style borscht, which I often have!). Jaspers might just like ham and egg sandwich, couldn't imagine something more than that. At last, Mira likes cup noodles, but only when eating with her closest friend!</p>
          <p>Wait you are asking non-lore OCs as well? Golden Kiwi fell in love with the sandwiches which is sold in a nearby sandwich shop, they taste particularly good. Kyrea likes chocolate, I'm quite certain. And in case you are asking mine, my favourite is omurice.</p>
          <h2>Why is your cover page art has these line up of characters?</h2>
          <p>Cosmos, Lavender and Kyrea is, or at one point, my favourite OCs, that wasn't too hard to guess, right? The old art also includes a yellow girl, that is actually my very old sona, used when I was a toddler. Though having a 5 year old as a sona seems strange, so she's currently vibing in the corner of my brain. And Jaspers' situation is similar to Cosmos, but stranger. Really dunno how to explain it, I like his vibes.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions, you can tell me in the guestbook or something, see you later~</p>

        <div class="content">
        <h1>Man I hope nobody I know irl sees this</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>In my life, I didn't have much chance of discussing LGBT related topics with my family or anyone irl, the only time I did is during a camp in university. I wouldn't have known about not being straight or cis being possible if I had never gone on the internet. I support those who are LGBT, but I never assumed that I may be not straight, until I did.</p>
          <p>When I was younger, there was a girl I really admired, she seemed to be good at everything, and was popular in class, unlike me, who got bullied all the time. I thought she was very cool and kinda wished I could be friends with her. After graduation, I felt that admiration was more than just admiration, but I did not understand why, as I thought girls couldn't like girls. And even when I knew about that later on, I still felt that feeling wasn't the same when I had crushes on guys. Other than that girl, I don't have any other girl crushes that I could analyse. Although I know bisexuality and pansexuality and others doesn't have to be 50/50 attraction, that experience feels far too uncertain to be actual crush.</p>
          <p>I also questioned whether I am demiromantic and/or demisexual, since I tend to have crushes who I bonded with closely, and rarely acquaintances. What confuses me is that I still find some strangers (both male and female) attractive, online sources say sexual attraction, romantic attraction, and aesthetic attraction are all different, but I'm still having a hard time figuring them all out. For now I think I'm neither of that, but the questioning really helped me understand it is ok to not go through the same process when having romantic feelings.</p>
          <p>It was kinda a hard question, but I don't have anyone to discuss. I feel icky talking about romance and affection, I still feel uncomfortable mentioning that to my sister, who is the person I trust the most. And so here I am, posting this to online where anyone can see it. I'm certain that the chances of my family seeing this is very minuscule, and there is no benefit to strangers after seeing this information anyways. At the time being, I don't feel comfortable calling myself bisexual or heterosexual, so I will label myself as questioning. No matter what I actually am, I will try to accept myself. I wonder how others figure out their sexuality.</p>

      <button class="collapsible" title="OC, Dream">Seeing my OC in my dreams <span class="blogdate">( 23 Oct 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>Cosmos why do you keep appearing</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>For the past few weeks, Cosmos has been appearing in my dreams and I have no idea why. Maybe it is a sign that I should one day make a series out of my OCs, though I have no confidence in my storybuilding skills.</p>
          <p>Months before, I have actually seen her in my dreams, well, I became her actually. I remember I was flying around buildings and saving people from evil people. It is a thrilling experience, being chased by missiles. At a certain point I have hide, and some nice guy offered to let me stay. So I did, until he passed away from old age. </p>
          <p>I have mentioned this dream in my mini blog. There wasn't much going on in the dream, and I couldn't see Cosmos as well. But I could feel she was somewhere near me, it is nice to have some company, and it felt kinda real for some reason.</p>
          <p>A few days later, I had a dream where I was watching a new season of Jewelpet ( which was my childhood, though I wouldn't say it's good as I thought ), at the peak of the episode when the main characters are fighting the villains, Cosmos appeared as one of the allies ( she got defeated though ). I lost it when I saw her, and gushed how my OC ended up in a TV show. But dreams are difficult to control, no matter how many times I try to rewind, I could find that scene anymore.</p>
          <p>And this dream happened last night, I was browsing the interet like usual, then I found a website, I think it's some sort of obscure character shrine, and it turns out, guess what, Cosmos is part of it. I was very happy, she's gained enough popularity that she became some people's favourite character. Though the rest of the dream is kinda blurry, I remember I was looking at the people's headcanons and theories and stuff.</p>
          <p>It feels fun if I show my OCs to a larger audience, but I know that I am bad at looking between the lines and understanding implications, and it is very difficult to improve, this is why I am bad at writing despite I'm quite confident at my English. For now, I'll guess I should keep the stories in my brain.</p>

      <button class="collapsible" title="Review, Game">Cookie Run Kingdom: Golden Cheese Arc Thoughts <span class="blogdate">( 20 Oct 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>*Ugly crying*</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>After years of waiting, we finally got the Golden Cheese story we've always wanted. And despite all the worries, the story turned out amazing, at least for me.</p>
          <center><u><i>Warning: This entire post contains spoilers for chapters 17 and 18.</i></u></center>
          <p>Before the release, everyone speculated that Golden Cheese is a tyrant who was greedy and faked her backstory just to get the cheesebirds to worship her, and the kingdom seems to be less developed than the rest of the kingdoms.</p>
          <p>Chapter 17 came out, but to everyone's shock, the kingdom is very cyberpunk ( well this kingdom is the richest after all ), and there are cookie citizens aside from cheesebirds. As the Gingergang explored they eventually found out the kingdom is a virtual world, created by Golden Cheese's soul jam powers. We found out Golden Cheese lost her kingdom during the Dark Flour War, in guilt and grief, she vowed to bring them all back in a world without suffering and war. It is true that she is a greedy queen, but what surprises me is how the story portrays greediness. This word is usually negative, but through out the storyline, it is seen as something positive. Golden Cheese's greed is to protect her kingdom, her people, her treasure, even if she has to trap herself in a sarcophagus and leave the Ancients behind. Her caring and generous (?) side was shown, she loves her subjects and people, she's a way nicer person than all of us thought <span style="font-size:0.66em">We should apologise to her for misunderstanding her-</span>. However, how do the Gingergang convince her to join the Ancients if she refuses to leave her Golden City?</p>
          <p>Prior to Chapter 18's release, I was worried that the story writers will mess up mid way, just like Dark Cacao arc ( hot take: Dark Cacao arc sucks and rushed, and no it is not a English translation problem ). And in the teaser, it is implied Smoked Cheese is Affogato 2.0, which immensely worried me. I was actually deciding to move back to my Blue Lock alt if the story fucks up, even though the recent Blue Lock chapter is boring me a bit.</p>
          <p>Well CRK story writers surprised me again. The reason Smoke Cheese is plotting against Golden Cheese is because that he disagrees with how she is ruling the kingdom, he thinks the Golden City should be expanded instead of being protected and hidden, so that it can be more powerful and fight back all forces. He has good intentions after all, but he kinda got taken away by his own greed. He tolden the citizens that they are all illusions and stole Golden Cheese's soul jam, he even tried to kill her true form to gain full control of her soul jam. This will be quickly solved if she returns to the real world, but the Golden City will be closed down, and this city is the only way her citizens can thrive, right?... Then the Gingergang spoke up, Wizard encouraged her that there will be more information outside of her kingdom to bring her people back to life, Olive and Adventurer promised to not reveal the secrets of Golden City to the public, she now has allies that help to protect what she loved, so that she can find to solution of true happiness for her people ( ok this is one of the few times I don't hate the presence of the Gingergang ). </p>
          <p>Golden Cheese finally meets the Light of Radiance, which is the section I love very much. Her light scolds Golden Cheese for refusing to leave her City, thus slowly losing other things she also cared about, like her Cheesebirds from outside world. Her light compared this to holding sand in her fists, it keeps falling out of her hands, yet she refuses to let go and grab onto other things. And what is Golden Cheese's solution? If sand falls out of her hands, she'll just make her hands bigger! She vowed to become more powerful, before she reopens the city, she will gain more strength, so that everything she desires will be protected, so that the sand will not fall out of her hands again. I'm sure this is a metaphor I've heard before, if this is true, the story writer really incorporated the metaphor really well.</p>
          <p>Before the Golden City closes down, High Priest Cheesenbird has comforted the people that they won't disappear, but just fall into a long slumber. As the city and its citizens slowly fades away, a child goes to his mother and wishes her a good sleep, which is extremely gut-wrenching. Before you thought all the feels are over, Cheesenbird also tells Golden Cheese to find a treasure in the canyon during sunset. When the cookies arrives, Golden Cheese reunites with the survivors of her kingdom: the Cheesebirds who are taking care of the virtual world. Their ancestor Cheesenbird tolden them to prepare for Golden Cheese's return every sunset in the canyon. As the sunset shines onto the canyon filled with countless cheesebirds, she views her kingdom, proudly and tearfully. Out of all the things in the cookie game, it is the cheesebirbs that make me cry.</p>
          <p>In the epilogue, Golden Cheese finally reunites with the Ancients and new allies: Pitaya and the Crème Republic. What's funny and a bit tragic is she likely hasn't known the truth about White Lily yet. I wonder how would Golden Cheese take the news. </p>
          <p>I would rate this story 9/10, the only imperfection is I'm not a big fan of how Smoked Cheese is the antagonist of the story, though he has good intentions, he tried to sabotage the kingdom, and I actually think this story does not necessarily need an antagonist. Nevertheless, this story made it to my top 3 favourite Cookie run stories, the rest of them being Operation: Timeguard and Council of the Heroes. Cookie Run stories can be hit-or-miss, I'm so glad this time they made a story so wonderful.</p>
          <p>There are a few mysteries unsolved, like how Fettuccine didn't fade away like the rest of the citizens, and why Adventurer got a dream about Golden Cheese. Maybe Fettuccine may be one of the clues to bringing the dead people back to life. Also, the last time a non-soul jam user senses the power of soul jam is Royalberry, who is Hollyberry's son. Does that mean Adventurer is Golden Cheese's son? But that's just a theory, a game theory.</p>

        <div class="content">
        <h1>I don't have one</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>If someone ever asks me what color I like the most, I would reply,"No". Many colors have their own charm, and it is hard for just one color to shine on their own. However, when I was a child, my favourite color is yellow.</p>
          <p>Pretty sure it was my colorful imagination since I lived in a city with light pollution, I saw a sky of shiny stars outside my home. I fell in love with the sight, and I started to love the concept of stars and the color yellow. I would ask for stationaries and items that are yellow, and any characters with yellow color scheme I would immediately like. It's sad yellow color is underrated, the relatives called it piss color, I'm sure this is one of the many reasons why I hated my relatives.</p>
          <p>Funnily, before I even got out of my yellow phase, I started to own many pink things. My backpack was pink, my pencils were pink, so many things were pink. I don't really hate pink, but I was confused about how I unconsciously using pink things. I didn't complain though, those stuff were still very pretty looking.</p>
          <p>As I grow up, I felt more unsure about what my favorite color is. Is it yellow? Eh not anymore. Is it pink? It's cute but it gets boring. Is it teal? It's good but something's still amiss... I decided that I will say I don't have a favourite color at all, since all colors are pretty and unique in their own ways.</p>
          <p>However, I do have a favourite color combination, it is yellow and teal.</p>

        <div class="content">
        <h1>I wanted to talk about my height but I got insecure midway</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>This is the beginning of my Internet life, minus the time I clicked on random Youtube videos. It all began when I got Minecraft PC thanks to my dad. After that I messed around and joined various Minecraft servers, including Mineplex.</p>
          <p>Being a 10 year old kid, I was kinda annoying. I spammed the chat when being upset about something, but somehow, I made a friend there ( I'll refer him as J ). He was quite nice, so I kept playing games with him after school. Eventually J made other friends, and we created a small guild and made a group on Skype. Unfortunately after an incident, the group kinda disbanded, and we didn't really talk to one another again. I actually contacted J like a couple years ago, but we are like distant friends now, so we kinda went seperate ways despite on good terms.</p>
          <p>There was another friend I made on Hypixel. I couldn't remember much about him, I only remember he really likes scene fashion, and that he made me a couple skins which I still have them saved in my folders ( It may be one of the reasons why I couldn't stop adding cat ears to my characters ). I felt a bit guilty losing his contact, I just hope he is doing well.</p>
          <p>Pretty sure people who is wary of Internet stuff would be very shocking how I never encountered any creeps during this, as I grew up, I was surprised by this as well. I felt like one of the reasons is that I kept my age a secret mostly, as I was very insecure about it. But mostly I think I was just very lucky. My dad yelled at me before for making online friends, it didn't stop me, I only became more careful to not let anyone know I have friends on the Internet. This could be dangerous. I believe you shouldn't punish kids for socialising on the Internet, but you should monitor and communicate with the children to prevent dangers.</p>
          <p>Despite sad stuff that happened, I think this experience kinda saved me from complete loneliness. I was bullied at school, but after playing Minecraft, I had common interests with some classmates and made friends in real life, then I also bonded with people on Minecraft servers. And if you read the last post, Minecraft was the reason why I started drawing in the first place. Though I don't play Minecraft much anymore, I still look back and be happy for all the things that happened.</p>

        <h1>Ohh, someone's birthday or smth?</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>Today is the special day! In 2015 on the same day, I started my art journey by drawing my Minecraft skin ( <a href="/oc/kyrea.html" target="_blank">A.K.A. Kyrea</a> )for the very first time.</p>
          <p>First and foremost, I would like to thank Mishymolly from Mineplex forums ( I don't know their other social medias ). I was browsing the website like usual, and I saw a post from Mishymolly, a guide on how to draw Minecraft skins. Not sure what got to me, but I suddenly had motivation to pick up a pencil and doodle as well. I struggled a bit, and hesitated to share my drawing to the world, but eventually I did. Guess what, the OP complemented my art! My confidence on my art skill skyrocketed, then I never stopped drawing.</p>
          <p>I have sent several thank you messages in the past, though I don't recall if they replied or seen any of them. Kinda sad they may not be aware that they singlehandedly changed a life. If I never started drawing, I wouldn't have created so many characters and stories in my head, or bonded with people through drawing fanart. Heck, my beloved OCs like Cosmos and the others wouldn't have existed if that never happened ( Oh and I wouldn't have studied Visual Arts back in secondary school, but uh that doesn't matter as much. ).</p>
          <p>Anyways holy fuck drawing changed my life by a ton, I really recommend trying to draw if you haven't. "Oh but I couldn't even draw a stickman-" Drawing a crappy stickman is alright! You don't have to strive to become the best artist to create art, and everyone starts somewhere. Try to start by drawing the things you love, maybe a character or an animal. If you end up still not enjoyig art, it's ok, because you tried something new! But if you did love drawing, congrats you found a new hobby!</p>
          <p><s>Ok why did I spout so much motivational speech</s> Lastly, happy birthday to Kyrea! And kinda happy birthday to me, since I see this day as the day I'm reborn. ( P.S. I would like to offer a sincere apology to Lavender, whom I forgot about her birthday ( 25 July ) yet again. )</p>

        <div class="content">
        <h1>Been a while since my last update, finally have some new stuff to share.</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>It's finally school day, the first classes went quite well, one of the lecturers seemed very chill, hope it will remain enjoyable. And today I wanna share that I'm building my secondary school in Minecraft.</p>
          <p>I don't actually like my secondary school that much, it's not too bad, it's just not much interesting stuff happened there. However, ever since I'm a child, I enjoyed roleplaying daily life in Minecraft, like I have said the post before the last one. Despite not liking school, pretending to attend school in Minecraft is oddly comforting. Recently, I have the bizzare thought of building my secondary school, which I haven't visited for an entire year, using a few references and my memory.</p>
          <p>I will refrain from posting any pictures of my build because I don't want to reveal what town I'm living in, so i will just talk about it. At the first step of building, I questioned myself if constructing such a huge building was even feasible, it would take forever and, I might get repetitive strain injury first before I complete 10% of it. I wondered if there're commands out there that can speed up the process... That's when I realised /fill and /clone are a thing, damn those are life savers indeed.</p>
          <p>The exterior is nothing to worry about, though I have a lot of problems with the individual rooms. I have blurry memories of some of the rooms for I don't often need to go in there, and some I have never entered at all. I have to decorate the room using my imagination, or just give up and leave the room blank. I got that urge to visit my old school just to see what the small parts look like, but TBH I don't feel much connection with it anyways, going there is too awkward.</p>

      <button class="collapsible" title="Life">Blood donation <span class="blogdate">( 27 Aug 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>I donated blood the second time yesterday, so I decided to make this the topic of this post.</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>I don't know why the motivation for giving my blood is so strong. As a kid I watched my mom donating blood, then I decided I wanted to do the same when I grow up. Also I can know what my blood type is, but the answer is quite obvious considering how much mosquitoes love me :/</p>
          <p>This is a somehow related incident which got me into a hospital. At grade 7, I got rashes on my arms and legs, and it turned out I got ITP ( Immune thrombocytopenic purpura ), what happened is that my immune system said "fuck them platelets" and attacked my platelets, causing bleeding and bruises. Don't worry I'm all fine now, but it certainly took me a while to understand this disorder, I wasn't allowed to donate blood yet because I didn't know the details of my disorder, I didn't even know it's a immune disease and not a blood disease. </p>
          <p>After all confusion is cleared up, I successfully had my first blood donation. They also gave me two bottles of iron supplements. There were no discomfort for me luckily, but maybe I needed more time for my wound. The next day I went to Macau with my sister, when returning to Hong Kong, I checked out my band-aid ( which was covered by my sleeve ), and it was covered in dried blood, quite scary NGL. I got the results of my blood type, it's O positive, nice but wouldn't say I'm surprised tho.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to yesterday, I went there the second time. I got a little pin, I have a fascination for small and shiny stuff, I love this thing a lot. During the blood drawing process, it seemed everything went well. However, few minutes after that, I started feeling odd, but I thought it's just my body being weird like usual, until my vision went static-like. After a short break and many Kit-kat bars, my body went back to normal. I think it's caused by a larger amount of blood drawn than last time ( 450 ml instead of 350 ml ). At least I know my body limits now ( and it's kinda funny lol ).</p>
          <p>It's a nice experience, wonder how many cool pins I can get.</p>

      <button class="collapsible" title="Game">Minecraft PE: The First Sunset <span class="blogdate">( 23 Aug 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>Remember the time when everyone played Minecraft?</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>Have you played Minecraft PE as a child? I did not play Minecraft PC version because I was not aware of its existence yet, and pretty sure I downloaded the pirated version before I moved to PC. If you experienced it, you may know compared to PC, PE version has a lot of limitations. No commands, less items and no time changes for creative mode. The time is permanently stuck at noon, sunny. I built a city full of buildings on a flat world, like school, hotels, shops, and played around like it's my toy house. Nevertherless, the fact the sky never changes and nobody besides me are in this map, made me feel very lonely.</p>
          <p>An particularly memorable but tragic experience, involving a dead young Minecraft pup. I had a baby wolf, barely born but I know it was my favourite. I named it Cupcake, and gave her pink collar. One day, I took it out for a walk, and it fell into a pool. Apparently, in the old version of PE, baby animals drown. I started panicking when I saw it getting hurt, not remembering to move away to let it teleport to somewhere safe. Unfortunately, I did not find a solution, and it drowned to death. As a kid, I was traumatised, my sister found it funny though. I made a grave besides my house, and got another baby wolf and made it exactly like Cupcake. And let me tell you, this Cupcake could not escape the Horrifying fate of dying in an freak accident, like riding on a glitchy rollercoaster that somehow kills the passenger. This particular dog was so memorable I made an oc based on her. I haven't given her a new design, but I'm not sure if it's actually a good idea, a young child who gets killed over and over again sounds morbidly scary, not even the story I'm working on right now matches this OC.</p>
          <p>Ok back to my main topic, about the daytime thing. I performed daily activities in my city like in real life, I woke up, tidied myself, went to school, went back home, and went to bed. I even checked the clock to see which time I should start and stop doing certain stuff, I was dedicated. However, the fact there is no night time bothered me a lot. One day, I was doing the usual stuff, but I felt something was off, the lighting seemed to change. I looked up at the sky, the sun, which was supposed to be at the center of the sky, was moving. The sun was slowing descending into the ground, and the sky was turning orange. I was extremely hyped, I remember I stayed in my house, and just watched the sky turn from orange to black, staring at it like it was the most beautiful thing in the world, and it IS beautiful, I felt like I actually live in that world.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately I lost this world due to a bug. I fell out of the world while playing Spleef on my own. For some reason, I respawned on an empty land instead of in my bed. I tried to look for my city, but it was nowhere to be found. At least it gave me good memories...</p>

      <button class="collapsible" title="Discussion, Vent">On the topic of romance stories: A rant <span class="blogdate">( 15 Aug 2023 )</span></button>
      <div class="content">
        <h1>I edited this post a lot too much</h1>
        <center><u>Warning: This post is more angry-sounding, but this is not an attack to shippers, I just require a place where I can vent these feelings. Apologies if I'm too rude.</u></center>
          <div class="text">
          <p>Ever since I was a child, I do not feel anything when a pair of characters end up in a romantic situation, like a girl slipping into a boy's arms and the bgm becomes jazzy. I tend to feel apathetic, or even become very irritated by how it ruins the plot and atmosphere. I especially hate how even my favourite shows always show stuff like this. "It's unrealistic! It's cliche!", I thought to myself, then I usually I turn off the TV.</p>
          <p>When I started to use social media more, I found out that people actually enjoy these moments, so much so they make fanart, video edits of their favourite ships. When I look up my childhood anime on Youtube, it's often the ship videos that showed up, and I was kinda bewildered that they didn't feel annoyed about romance stuff like me. Eventually I learnt that majority of media-consumers are really a big fan of romantic plots, ok so they are not pretending to enjoy these stories.</p>
          <p>I should try to explain why I tend to hate romantic plots, but I couldn't actually explain it. I thought it is because it is not original: Boy and girl didn't like each other, suddenly danger ensues or something weird happens, then they <i>immediately</i> fall in love. Or the process of love brewing is so cheesy I hate it, the slightest hint ( like two characters staring into each other's eyes ) makes my skin crawl.</p>
          <p>Despite all this, I found a few ships that I particularly enjoy. By the time I'm writing this, there are four ships listed on my Ships page. Like I said there, I tend to like a ship when I find the fanart particularly cute, or the ship is enemies to lovers. Well not really enemies, the type of enemies to lovers that I like is more of "They compete with each other but still like/admire each other a lot" kind of relationship. I can actually feel the characters grow and develop together other than just sweetness that I can't taste.</p>
          <p>Once again, if I sound too harsh, I'm extremely sorry. It is ok if you enjoy your romance stories, I just have different taste, that's all.</p>

      <button class="collapsible" title="Discussion">Strange fears I have <span class="blogdate">( 14 Aug 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>Why am I scared of these things??</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>Being afraid of heights and socialising is somewhat common so I won't talk about this here, but I believe there are many things I'm scared of that are unusual to other people.</p>
          <p>First of all, I have a huge fear of my teeth getting loose and falling out, and I'm very surprised how little people complain about this when everyone has experienced this horrifying situation. As a kid, I hated feeling the pain of my loose teeth whenever I accidentally bite it while eating. It would be easier if I simply pulled it out, but I did not have the balls to do that because ripping out a body part is mentally scarring, so my mom have to force me to stay stll and pull it out for me. I usually rewarded an ice-cream, sadly it never helped me with lessen the fear. Thank god I'm already over the age of baby teeth, sucks how I often have nightmares of me suddenly having teeth fall off.</p>
          <p>I really don't like the water heater at my home. The water heater my family uses has a temperature number display at the front, however, if the temperature is too low or too high, the display will start blinking. Also the heater makes weird noises, pretty sure it's normal heater behaviour, but it makes me extremely uneasy. I have freaked out multiple times just because the heater does stuff I don't recognise, like when someone modified the number by one degree, I have to change it back to the original temperature to feel less afraid. The fear has lessened, but it's still here.</p>
          <p>This is somewhat related the one above because it also involves increasing or decreasing numbers, and it is malfunctioning elevators. I have never gotten into an malfunctioning one, but in my nightmares, I quite frequently get trapped inside an elevator that is able to reach 40th floor and above when I'm in a 30-storey building, or the elevator floor number display goes down to negative numbers. When I use an elevator, and it starts making weird sounds, my heartbeat goes crazy. I pray my nightmares never come up with new elevator ideas, like irrational number floors for example.</p>
          <p>This is less of a fear, but more of something I'm disgusted of. Imagine a rainy day, you go out and go indoors, and you see the floor stained with dirt, leaves and whatever that weird goop is, and your shoes are soaked and dirty like the floor. If you hate situations like this, then I'm on the same page as you. I don't consider myself as a germaphobe, if I have to sit on the dry concrete floor, I wouldn't mind. But if, god forbid, that ground is still damp, I would rather jump out a building than come close to it. I hated this so much when I see the wet floor being contaminated by weird gunk, I would immediately clean it up. Just like majority of my fears, I don't know what caused this disgust, I have always hated wet floors in public bathrooms ever since my earliest memory. Nevertheless, it certainly motivated me to volunteer in cleaning beaches and contribute to society.</p>
          <p>I still yet to find people who hate these stuff as much as I do. If you think I'm being too sensitive, yes I am aware.</p>

        <div class="content">
        <h1>There's more?!</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>I have already written my favs in Fav Characters page, however, that list isn't actually the full one. The reason I don't list them all down is that:</p>
          <p>1. I like that character<u> when I was a child,</u> and it may not match my online personality(?)</p>
          <p>2. That character is <u>from a media that I'm not too interested,</u> and I don't want to be called a fake fan</p>
          <p>3. I only like that character<u> just a little bit</u></p>
          <p>Because of these reasons above, I don't feel necessary ( or comfortable ) sharing some characters. But the rules are kinda inconsistent, so some who fits this criteria might somehow make it into that page, while some don't. In this post, I think I'm willing to tell you some :3</p>
          <p>- I liked the protagonists<u> Ai-chan and Gan-chan from Yatterman,</u> I just thought they were quite cool. I haven't rewatched this anime but from their character designs, they seem like the type that I would still like today.</p>
          <p>-<u> Sara from Jewelpet Twinkle </u>and<u> Ran Shibuki from Aikatsu,</u> I didn't understand why I like them and refuse to believe I did, because I was not aware that it is possible to like characters of the same gender as myself ( the topic of sexuality I will talk about in the future ). But back in the day ( and now ), cool girls are one of my weaknesses.</p>
          <h2>Fast forward to many years</h2>
          <p>-<u> Amami Rantaro from Danganronpa V3 </u>and<u> Ghost Quartz from Houseki no Kuni </u>have very neat designs, but other than that, I wouldn't say I like them a fuck ton.</p>
          <p>- I found<u> Lyza from Made in Abyss </u> very gorgeous, but the source material scares me.</p>
          <p>-<u> Cookie Run </u>has a lot of pretty and cute designs,<u> Marshmallow Cookie and Squid Ink Cookie </u>particularly caught my eye, but not as much as my other cookie favs.</p>
          <p>- I think the dude's <u>Gajeel Redfox from Fairy Tail</u>, the metal dragon dude. I like how funny his character is while rewatching this series with my sister. Unfortunately, this series does not feel as entertaining when I was a kid.</p>
          <p>-<u> Yamada Asaemon Fuchi's ( from Hell's Paradise ) </u>character design brings me joy, reminds me of another character I know as a kid <span style="font-size:0.66em">( And what do you mean he's 20 )</span>.<u> Yamada Asaemon Shion </u> is a great character too, I love how laidback he is while being a teacher ( I only noticed he's making puns about his blindness in the manga ).</p>
          <p>-<u> Balam Shichiro ( from Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun ) </u>may seem scary at the beginning ( tbh I only feel his good vibes and not his scariness ), he's actually a wholesome teacher who likes giving headpats to cute animals. Not exactly invested in the series but I like this character a lot ( but I will never forgive him for cutting his own hair ).</p>
          <p>-<u> Adam from Record of Ragnarok</u>, who's based of Adam from the Bibile, is quite a memorable character. Aside from the fact he shares the same voice actor as my best boi Chigiri, he also dropped one of the my most memorable quotes:
          <br><i><u>"'Hatred'? 'Revenge'? I don't need any of that. There is no reason why. Is there any man that needs a reason to protect his own children?"</u></i>
          <br>I don't care how many people say the animation sucked, this arc is very banger.</p>

        <div class="content">
        <h1>Well at least most of them</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>As a proud consumer of internet media for almost 10 years, I've collected many fun facts of my blorbos. To expand your knowledge, I'm sharing these stuff to you.</p>
          <h2>Tojo Kirumi</h2>
          <p>Her birthday is on 10th May, which is Maid Day in Japan.</p>
          <h2>Amethyst Twins</h2>
          <p>I'm too lazy to look for the image right now, but in an official art, they were shown to have white hair instead of purple.</p>
          <h2>Pomegranate Cookie</h2>
          <p>In an event for Millennial Tree Cookie's release, when you complete the event, there is a sprite which Pome kneels down in defeat. However, the sprite is not found anywhere, not even in the official Dropbox.</p>
          <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Etr8S2kVoAAECfn?format=jpg&amp;name=small">
          <h2>DJ Cookie</h2>
          <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/CRKingdomEN/status/1486474091808837637/photo/1" target="_blank">twitter post by the official CRK account</a>, DJ Cookie was seen in the background, however, they were not released in the update.</p>
          <h2>Mutsu</h2>
          <p>I have mentioned this in the favourite characters page, but her surname is 安江.</p>
          <h2>Kuon Wataru</h2>
          <p>In his flashback, Kuon's team (狐坂) lost to another team (豆狸). 狐 means fox/kitsune and 狸 can mean tanuki. From what I know, in Japanese legends these two animals often contrast each other.</p>
          <h2>Chigiri Hyoma</h2>
          <p>Well this is more of a theory than fun fact, anyways, many people believe that the reason his jersey number is 4 is because it refers to his future death of his soccer dream ( 4 sounds like death in Japanese ), which I don't exactly agree. In Blue Lock, 299 out of 300 will be eliminated and only one winner will be chosen. Just because Chigiri has a possibility of breaking his ACL the second time and having to quit football, doesn't mean his elimination will be more special than others <span style="color:38445E;">( Hover to see spoilers:&nbsp;<span class="spoiler">Yukimiya also has eyesight problems that may end his soccer career, you know</span>&nbsp;)</span>. I'm not too sure about the true meaning of the 4, but one theory I have, the 4 represents how he once wanted to give up soccer by being eliminated in Blue Lock, hence killing his dream.</p>
          <p>Another dumber explanation is that if you write 千 in his surname 千切 poorly, it would look like 4.</p>
          <h2>Barou Shouei</h2>
          <p>Barou has an obsession with cleanliness (潔癖), but that word contains 潔, which can also refer to the name Isagi in Kanji. And yes, Barou is strongly obsessed with Isagi in the story.</p>
          <p>That's all I could think of for now, hope you feel enlightened after reading these useless info.</p>

      <button class="collapsible" title="OC, Art">Nostalgia file <span class="blogdate">( 9 Aug 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>Wow the file isn't lost</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>After Artfight ended, I tidied up my OCs, then I remembered aside from Cosmos and other main OCs, I've got a fuck ton of OCs that I promised to never forget. When I was younger, I made a tiny list of OCs in a note, and taped it in a file. It's been a while the last time I saw that file, so I assumed I lost it... but I found it quite easily!</p>
          <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4ujtpgdib62g95j817rsn/IMG_6076_2025-Jan-02.jpg?rlkey=r5nyxlarf8b9zf6qa33sjj9de&st=c1ifwufm&raw=1">
          <p>Oh how I missed you, orange file with a drawing of a cat on the cover. I used to bring drawing papers in this file, and store important stuff, like homework list and to-do list. But ever since I got a smaller container for the scraps of paper, I stopped bringing this file to school. I don't need to bring an A4 file for A5 paper. Now, look at my to-do list.</p>
          <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/osfdobzcbtowupp12lloe/IMG_6071_2025-Jan-02.jpg?rlkey=navm81anhggj4qsd54egnlsh1&st=kwss3btt&raw=1">
          <p>Being a forgetful child, I had to remind myself of important stuff by writing them down in somewhere accessible, so I used this file. I frequently added and erased stuff on this paper, but I'm pretty sure I changed the paper occasionally, that's why it doesn't look scrambled. A few fun facts about this note, firstly,<u> 2015.9.19 15:32 </u>refers to the time and date I took the picture of my first Minecraft drawing, which marks the starting point of my art journey. Come to think of it, it has almost been 8 years since that day, damn that's long. Secondly, hey isn't that Lavender, why is she look like a Minecraft character and why is she crying? The drawing is actually meant to represent a craft I made for Design and Technology class ( best subject along with Home Economics BTW ), because I made it so good, my teacher decided to exhibit them in the school's Open Day. Unfortunately, that meant I couldn't take it home until the Open Day ended.</p>
          <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9kjwb9y4a25d4hsdyt1b2/IMG_6081_2025-Jan-02.jpg?rlkey=nvovqzu5tp1r0fq8n8w54psub&st=4k8h6q1c&raw=1">
          <p>Hm strange, I thought I stuck the OC list in my file. Did I threw it away in fear of my classmate finding my file, reading it and make fun of me like what happened before ( fucking asshole 屌你老母 )? Wait a sec...</p>
          <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nar21rfg19aotb9g95yva/IMG_6073_2025-Jan-02.jpg?rlkey=ohmlozts79fh33lflg6u20r5f&st=idxo1nho&raw=1">

          <p>It's underneath the paper, that's clever of me. Some of the names are familar, some I forgot. The censored name is me ( or my old sona ), then the next character is the magical cat creature Kelly. Cupcake... oh that will be a story for another day. Niya is currently Claire, and 灰 in Chinese is Grey, yes, that one I have rn. Rain is short for Rainbow, which I haven't introduced to anyone here, but I think I will redesign her soon. Kris and Kristy are supposed to be Kyrea's friends ( I think I forgot to put Kyrea in this list ), and they are twins. Oh there's Yume and Linia ( current name Mira ), why the hell did I name her Linia? The rest of the characters I believe are not too interesting, or came from a dream that would take forever to explain.</p>
          <p>Well that's a nostalgia trip, glad this historical artifact was never thrown away. Before I end this post, let me show you my enormous collection of doodles files.</p>

      <button class="collapsible" title="Life">Travelling to Okinawa <span class="blogdate">( 6 Aug 2023 )</span></button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>I miss Okinawa TBH</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>My aunt is going to Japan soon, so she asked me to exchange the remaining yen I have. Calculating the unholy amount of coins I collected, I was flushed by the memories staying in hotels, queuing for the washing machines with 100 yen coins in my hands, or the times I counted the 1 yen coins and 10 yen coins for vending machines. A lot of stuff happened there, but I miss Japan quite a lot.</p>
          <p>So in this post, I will write my experience travelling in Okinawa because it feels awful not having someone to infodump to, I will stop writing until I'm done or I go to sleep. But first, backstory time.</p>
          <p>My teacher sent us a form for applying to join a study tour to Okinawa, and those applied might get a sponsorship which might cover the entirety of the trip. It wouldn't hurt to give it a try, I said. A few months later, the teacher announced in class that I successfully got the sponsorship, meaning I got a free trip to Japan! For some reason, I was the only one who applied for the form in the class, so nobody I know would be joining me, that sucks.</p>
          <p>May 27 night, I had to go to the airport earlier because there were no midnight buses that work that late. My sister decided to accompany to the bus stop, which was very nice of her. While waiting for the bus, I shared Blue Lock fan art on twitter to my sister ( she's also a fan of Blue Lock ), and chatted what to do in Okinawa. The bus finally arrived, I said goodbye to my sister, then proceeded to enjoy the ride, listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/gEhuGPXxRrA" target="_blank">Curses by The Crane Wives</a>.</p>
          <p>At the airport, I gathered with my groupmates. Feeling bored by the fact we will have to wait for over 5 hours, we started playing Card Against Humanity but Hong Kong version. Like the socially-awkward person I am, I do not know many of the slangs in the cards, but somehow I never lost a round. Then finally we saw the teachers, tour guides and other students gathering. We went to immigration, standard airport stuff, then I proceeded to get lost. With the help of my groupmates, I rushed to the destination with the 6 a.m. sunlight shining through the window</p>

          <center>What the heck it's so pretty</center>
          <p>Contrary to what I believed, I was not running late, everyone was still there. We took a group photo and we finally entered the plane. And of course, as celebration, I took a photo of the window and my little transparent pouch containing my Pome keychain and Timekeeper pin.</p>

      <h1>History of Lavender</h1>
        <div class="text">
        <p>It wouldnt't be fair if I explained how I created Cosmos but not Lavender, right?</p>
        <p>Lavender originated from a dream back in<u>&nbsp;25 July, 2018.</u>&nbsp;There was not much to see in my dream, but suddenly, a figure appeared. A pink-haired girl with braids wearing an oversized white blouse, staring at my with her blue eye with the other covered by her bangs. Her colors look strangely simliar to<u>&nbsp;my other OC Kyrea,</u>&nbsp;and the overall vibes oddly reminds me from<u>&nbsp;Ghost Quartz from Houseki no Kuni&nbsp;</u>( I was obsessed with this series back then ). I managed to wake up during the night, and quickly drew her appearance. Me getting out of the room seemed to have disturbed my sister who was sleeping on the top of the bunker bed, she told me to get back to sleep and I did after I finished the drawing. The very next day, I designed a full outfit for her, and gave her the name&nbsp;<u>"Yume"</u>, because she's born from a dream, how original.</p>
        <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5hg1fcq3e7vbosjrxizb0/yume_2025-Jan-02.JPEG?rlkey=ei5ijhdmh3ck6lm1vbdpx5hap&st=ze92wv20&raw=1">

        <center>( Look at my old drawing of Kyrea, man how time flies )</center>
        <p>However, she is not the only person who is born that day. After I went back to bed, another dream came to me. This time, a girl with mint-color, short hair visited. But not wanting to bother my sister again, I did not walk out of the room to draw this time. Thanks to that, my memory of her was more vague. Moreover, her design is not as appealing to me, no matter what outfit gave her, it did not feel right. Nevertheless, I wanted her to be some sort of counterpart to Yume. I called her<u>&nbsp;Mira,</u>&nbsp;which is short for<u>&nbsp;Miracle.</u></p>
        <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/duze0zw0v4a5jhnv94r5i/miraa_2025-Jan-02.png?rlkey=u1un7r85npd0apkn20uywuqro&st=xhefh9ce&raw=1">
        <center>( I'm still not satisfied of this design )</center>
        <p>With the birth of these two characters, I came up with a idea for a story for them. I imagined Yume as a wizard whose job is to guard the gates of the world of dreams, and Mira as an adventurous girl who accidentally got lost in that land. They travel together to help Mira get back home, and on the way, we get to know how to two character bond together, Yume's loneliness, Mira's desire for freedom, and how the world of dreams is crumbling away slowly.</p>
        <p>Well, years has passed and it seems the direction for this story has not changed much. Yume- I mean Lavender is still the protagonist, the world is still dying, and the plot might still revolve around loneliness. But this time, I'm not sure where I should put Mira in the story. One thing I'm sure is that she will be a crucial part of the lore, please&nbsp;<span style="font-size:0.66em">(don't)</span>&nbsp;stay tuned.</p>

        <center>( have this shitty meme )</center>
        <p>( While I'm writing this, I went to take a photo of the old design of Yume/Lavender. What I'm shocked about is she did not have the cat ear thing in the first drawing, meaning I added it just because I wanted to. Please Kiwi you have countless OCs with animal ears already. )</p>

        <h1>Red hair again</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>Don't think I have ever mentioned this to anyone, but I noticed something about my top 4 favourite characters, they all have red hair.</p>
          <p>When Chigiri became one of my favourite characters, the fact he has red hair and is a speedster makes me joke to myself,"Lol of course you like a character with red hair and runs very fast you Pome fan." But at that point of time Holly is also my top fav, and that would make three of my fav having<u>&nbsp;red ( or pinkish-red at least )&nbsp;</u>color scheme and red hair. I wondered, what if the next character who becomes my fav also has red hair?</p>
          <p>The next character who enters my top blorbo list is Barou Shouei, subverting my expectations as usual, he does not have red hair. But the rule of red color is never broken, his aura color is black and red. I can still joke about how I'm only interested in red-colored characters.</p>
          <p><span style="color:#38445E;">( Hover to see spoilers:&nbsp;<span class="spoiler">Sike this is not the end of it, in the manga, it is revealed that Barou dyed his hair, and he has red streaks in his hair.&nbsp;<a style="color:#1b1d4c;text-decoration-color:#1b1d4c;" href="https://twitter.com/rayuga101x/status/1664435148409151488?s=12&amp;t=gTX75ItvhsrLrdZn6VYDRA">Click here to see the pic.</a>&nbsp;That means the pattern has not broken yet, poggers!</span>&nbsp;)</span></p>
          <p>This is quite a strange phenomenon, as my favourite color is not really red ( I don't even have a particular favourite color, only a favourite color combination, which is<u>&nbsp;blue and yellow&nbsp;</u>). But if this pattern continues, it will be funny as hell.</p>

        <h1>Origin of Cosmos</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>If you have been checking out my posts, you might occasionally see me draw a character with gold hair and blue wings. Of course, that's none other than<u>&nbsp;Cosmos.</u></p>
	         <img src="../oc/ref/Cosmos.png" alt="A slightly muscular woman with gold hair and blue cat ears and wings">
	         <p>You might ask: Why do you draw her so much (Or maybe you don't care but TBH, I don't care if you don't care)? Well this dates back in<u>&nbsp;15 November, 2021 ( her birthday :3 ),</u>&nbsp;when I was thinking of making a new sona, an attempt to increase my self-esteem somehow. Being shy and weak my entire life, I imagined a character who is extroverted, cheerful, and full of confidence (perhaps too much confidence lmao). I think I was basing her on<u>&nbsp;my Sky: COTL avatar, the Valley Elders, Hollyberry cookie, and Madeleine Cookie.</u></p>
	         <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/uuf5i2orwzxd78m9pluoe/IMG_7647_2025-Jan-02.JPG?rlkey=7tcmiala5tva94n417z0abum2&st=otzqkahh&raw=1" alt="Cosmos' first appearance">
          <p>At this point, she has not gotten a name, but I gave her the nickname&nbsp;<u>"Kiwy"</u>&nbsp;when I needed to refer to her somehow. A lot of changes was made to this character due to changes in my taste, lore stuff and simplifications (I do not like drawing complicated stuff). One main thing I removed is her twin tails, I liked twin tails a lot as a child, and they look very cute on my Sky Kid as well, but I eventually decided to change her hair, because the vibes didn't match well, and it IS a bit annoying drawing twin tails along with cat ears. The other aspect of her altered is her cape. I mean, wings are quite cool despite how hard it is to draw them.</p>

          <p>The first colored picture of Cosmos is in 2022 September (Though I have planned her color scheme for a long while), the colors remained quite identical to the current design aside from different clothings. I believe it is around this time I continued the slow process of building the story for Lavender and added Cosmos to the story.</p>

          <p>Few weeks before Artfight, I had just finished the first OC reference for her. All was well except she has not have a name yet. After a few googling and brainstorming, I settled on the name Cosmos. Is the name perfect for her? Not sure, but the name sounds good, and that's what matters the most.</p>
	        <p> Here's the end of this post, you may wonder what is the lore for Lavender and Cosmos? You can check out my <a href="https://stardustisle.carrd.co/" target="_blank">OC card</a> here. Sadly, the story-building is extremely unfinished, my story-writing skills are very weak :(. But no matter what, Cosmos is my most favourite OC, I hope I can work on her more.</p>
