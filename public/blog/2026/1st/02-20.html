It's an event celebrated in many countries and places, and Hong Kong people celebrates it as well.</p><hr><h2>How my family celebrates</h2><p>In my point of view, Lunar New Year is a time where you wear new clothes, meet relatives, receive lai see 利是 or red packets, and eat dinner with family. Being someone who dislikes meeting relatives, it isn't a time I enjoy spending. However, what I look forward the most, and I believe most kids share the same belief, is the lai see, hell yeah free money.</p><p>Let's talk about how my family usually celebrates Lunar New Year/Chinese New Year. For my dad's family, we usually go to grandma's house quite early, all the family members that are in Hong Kong will be already there, then we would have lunch. After lunch, we would gather around and gift/receive lai see. To receive lai see, you have to tell the relatives new year greetings, such as 恭喜發財 (Wishing you prosperity)、新年快樂 (Happy New Year)，身體健康 (Have good health)、心想事成 (Wishes come true)、萬事如意 (Wishes come true, again)、大吉大利 (Great luck)、如意吉祥 (Everything goes well) etc, and since it's year of the horse, you can also say greetings with the theme of horse such as 馬到功成 (Instantly suceed). After that, it's kinda boring, just watch TV until it's dinner time.</p><p>For my mom's side, we go to a wine house 酒樓 to have a big dinner. When the food starting serving, the relatives will go around the tables and distribute the lai see. In 酒樓, the food tends to be similar. There's roasted suckling pig, lobster noodles (my fav), chicken, fried rice, steamed fish etc, and I always get full before the food gets all served.</p><p>They would also play 魚蝦蟹, a very simply gambling game. There's a sheet of paper containing six items to purchase: Fish, shrimp, calabash, coin, crab and chicken. There's also three dices which sides contains the six items mentioned. After the dice has been shaked in a bowl, you put money on the item(s) you wanna choose. When the dices get revealed, if one of them shows the item you select, you get double the money. If there's two of them, triple, if three, then quadruple. If none of the dices show the item you select, you lose your money. I'm not a huge gambler, so I never gamble with more than HKD$20, but I remember one year where I got double the money back, I was quite lucky.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/%E9%AD%9A%E8%9D%A6%E8%9F%B9%E9%AA%B0%E5%AF%B62.JPG/500px-%E9%AD%9A%E8%9D%A6%E8%9F%B9%E9%AA%B0%E5%AF%B62.JPG" alt="魚蝦蟹"><hr><h2>Money</h2><p>According to tradition, the best time to open lai see is the seventh day of Lunar New Year, but for those who don't care much about tradition, they might open it as soon as they can. When I was younger, I only open them when my parents told me to. But after I got older, I just open them whenever I want to.</p><p>Lai see used to be one of my major allowance sources, as someone who spends a lot of money on snacks and stationery, they can last me until next year. Most of the lai see I receive are HKD$20, they can also be HKD$10 or HKD$50. If the relatives are feeling generous, they might also give you HKD$100, or in rare cases: HKD$500!</p><hr><p>Apparently I forgot to upload this blog yesterday, so I'll do this now</p><p class="date">( 20 Feb 2026 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
