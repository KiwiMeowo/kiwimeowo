A little self-introduction!</h2><p>Hi I'm Kiwi, I like my OCs.</p><h2>2. How long have you been making OCs?</h2><p>I made OCs when I was just a toddler, a world where I was a magical girl and beat up bullies!</p><h2>3. Who was your first OC ever? (If you don't remember, answer for the earliest that you do remember.) Are they still in use? Did they go through any iterations?</h2><p>The earliest OC, or sona, has to be myself in magical girl form. She was my escape from being bullied almost every day. Oh I used to imagine myself being the world savior, so that the adults and classmates will not look down upon me anymore...</p><h2>4. Who is your favorite OC, currently?</h2><p>Cosmos, I love my muscular cat girl :3</p><h2>5. Who is your newest OC as of right now?</h2><p>I have not published these two OCs, as their designs and names has not reach the last stages. They will not be a significant part of the lore (At least in the current arc) as they are more like background characters in the clan of Luminescence. Fun fact, they are somewhat based off Horse Race Tests characters, so that's funny.</p><h2>6. How many OCs do you have? If you have multiple, then do you have blatant favoritism?</h2><p>There are 9 listed OCs in UtSS, 5 in Dreamland Workshop, and 4 in the others category. And I'm guilty to say I usually only care about the UtSS characters, I just love my magical world ok?</p><h2>7. Do you create OCs with other people, or is it mostly solitary?</h2><p>I don't have much opportunity to share my OC lore one-to-one, but if you want to you should tell me! (Man I should force my boyfriend to listen to my lore)</p><h2>8. Do you create your OCs for specific story(s)? What are the genre and common themes featured in your story(s)?</h2><p>Well I have UtSS and Dreamland Workshop, you might not know this, they are somewhat connected in a way. I find myself adding my inner turmoil into the lore, like being helpless by the uncertainty and cruelty of the world, anger towards being hurt by other people, then the fear realising it was because of myself that made me this messed up... How does this connect to the lore of my OCs you say, uhhh maybe one day I'll be competent enough to write them out.</p><h2>9. Are your OCs from a fandom?</h2><p>Only Golden Kiwi Cookie, aside from her, no.</p><h2>10. Do your OCs live in their own universe(s)? How different is their world from ours? (If you have fandom OCs you can still answer this with the world of the franchise!)</h2><p>UtSS and Dreamland Worldshop are based in a universe with magic systems, sometimes their magic can go haywire and destroy a lot of stuff in the process. The lines of reality and fiction can get blurred in my world.</p><h2>11. If you got isekai'ed into your OCs' universe (if there are multiple, pick some of the most notable), how long would you survive?</h2><p>I don't know how to use magic, nor draw magic circles or equations, under the apocalyptic world, abosolutely not.</p><h2>12. Do most your OCs belong to a (set of) species?</h2><p>Well kinda, most of them are humans, and Cosmos is a magical familiar called a Cometling.</p><h2>13. Do you draw pictures of your OCs? If so, what kind of pictures do you draw?</h2><p>I love drawing doodles. Usually they are not lore heavy, just slice of life things or just silly drawings.</p><h2>14. Do you enjoy drawing new reference sheets?</h2><p>They always look awkward and I hate it.</p><h2>15. Do you write about your OCs? If so, what sort of text do you write?</h2><p>I usually develop their lore in my head. But if I already have a clear idea on how their lore will progress, I will write them down in my notes, and sometimes post them here. The stuff I've written are often backstory stuff, but there is one spoiler-heavy scene that I've only shared in my friend's Discord server.</p><h2>16. Aside from drawing and writing, is there anything else you're doing for your OCs? Like… making a website, perhaps?</h2><p>I made this site as a way to talk about stuff I don't often get to, including OCs, so in a way I made this website for them. I've also made a website based off Grey, but it never really got completed as I've ran out of ideas.</p><h2>17. What's your general process in making new OCs?</h2><p>Oh hey I submitted this question! Anyways, there are many ideas in my head that gets slowly built up for many years. For example, I find characters who use umbrella as a sword/gun, but I hadn't seen characters who use compact umbrella as a weapon! Then I will save that idea until I find ways to connect to other ideas. After that, I will make a design based off the idea, or maybe the idea itself is tied to designs. When I'm satisfied with the outcome, I will publish it here.</p><h2>18. Relatedly, which comes first for you, the OC or the story setting?</h2><p>For my major OCs like Lavender, Cosmos, Grey etc, they come before the story setting. For those that aren't the main characters, like Jaspers and Bun (and several characters I've yet to introduce), I created them because I needed to expand on the world more. So yea it depends.</p><h2>19. Relatedly, how do you name your OCs?</h2><p>I look up words with meanings that remind me of my OC, then I pick the word that's the most suitable.</p><h2>20. Relatedly, do your OCs gain a life of their own during the creation process?</h2><p><s>(Wow I didn't know they can get sentience when they are created)</s> Not sure what you mean by gain a life of their own, but I suppose I'd never know what direction their lore will take in the future, like how I cannot predict how my life would go. Some of their lore is pretty much tied to my view in life and the world, so I don't think they will go very far off from my life.</p><h2>21. Relatedly, do you focus more on the design of the OC, or their personality? Or is it an even blend, or something else?</h2><p>I usually focus on their personality and story. When I focus only on design, I often lose interest in the OC quite quickly.</p><h2>22. Do you assign your OCs birthdays? Is their calendar different from ours?</h2><p>Every OC creator should celebrate their OCs birthdays. Their birthdays are usually their actual creation dates, I often open my old sketch folders, and find the earliest sketch I have of them.</p><h2>23. Do you keep track of OC creation dates? Do you consider the creation date to be their birthdays?</h2><p>See above!</p><h2>24. How do you handle OC ages? Do they age up with you, stay static, or grow within the universe?</h2><p>In the case, they used to age with me. But now, their age follows the lore.</p><h2>25. Are there any rules you set for yourself when making OCs? How often do you break these self-imposed rules?</h2><ul><li>Make the OCs look distinct, like giving them different shaped eyes</li><li>Don't give multiple characters similar looking clothing</li><li>Make their personalities distinct, if two concept OCs feel too similar, I just merge them</li><li>On the contrary, if the OCs' development is too drastic, I can just split them apart as two characters</li><li>Names that sound too real-life (John, Kevin, Mary, Zoe) sounds too weird in this world, avoid them.</li></ul><p>As for how often I break them, I suppose Ruth is a real life sounding name, but it suits Ruth somewhat considering its meaning. There is also a pair of exceptions of the distinct appearance rule, and there IS a lore reason for it.</p><h2>26. What are things you enjoy the most in OCs?</h2><p>(I feel like my suggested question is somewhat vague, as it refers to other people's OCs) What I enjoy in other people's OCs is that they are often a piece of that person's life. It can take a while to delve deep into the character's lore depending on how much story the creator decided to share, but you can get to know the core values of that person sometimes.</p><h2>27. Conversely, what are your pet peeves about OCs?</h2><p>While it's up to the person's preference and I can't stop them, I feel annoyed when a character's existence is just a vessel for suffering. Honestly I hate any media where a character is just a sad punching bag made for the audience to feel bad for them.</p><h2>28. What's the most common trope you fall into when making OCs and their stories? Do you even like these tropes?</h2><p>The depressed person trying to get out of a situation, a sidekick that help them (to varying degrees), and a evil voice speaking inside their head. There's also fourth walls, feeling of insignificance against the universe, and of course, magic.</p><h2>29. Conversely, do you have any trope you like but doesn't get to use it much in your OCs?</h2><p>Really powerful, intimidating figures in a team that are chill with one another, kinda like the Ancients in Cookie RUn Kingdom. The early concepts of the RS team is like that, but eventually I developed them as just some guys, so currently this trope is not yet present in my lore.</p><h2>30. Tell me the weirdest and wackiest piece of out-of-context OC lore you have.</h2><p>Plot armor is lore relevant.</p><h2>31. Tell me the saddest and most tearjerking piece of OC lore you have, with context if needed.</h2><p>I wouldn't call it teakjerking, but it's certainly depressing. One character which I didn't talk about much is Wolf, an OC I've based off some of the bullies in my life (Side topic, I find it weird to call them "my" bullies, like bitch fuck off from me). The current idea for him is that it will be like a revenge, they bullied me, I make a character that is in a toxic yaoi relationship with another character, and it will be funny.</p><p>However, the gay part isn't the funny part, the funny part is that Wolf will always reject that part of himself. While the concept of sexuality isn't really a thing, but basic love is, and some characters will still have different opinions on it. For Wolf, he's probably view love as a sign of weakness, especially after being with Raven (who is more awful than Wolf ever could). Unlike other characters, who will eventually learn to love themselves, Wolf will always feel he needs to stay away from any affection from his friends...</p><p>And at that point, it stops being funny, it's just depressing 😔. Sorry Wolf, but I won't stop until the bullies got their karma.</p><h2>32. Tell me the scariest and freakiest piece of OC lore you have, with context if needed.</h2><p>Raven is a scientist from Sky Pioneers who studies the land of Stardust Isle. He always had interest in astrology, and when he got into the team and obtained more resources, he began researching the sky and outer space... But eventually he realised something strange about the night sky, something horrible, something related to the destruction of this land... Can't say more cuz spoilers :P</p><h2>33. Tell me the sweetest and most wholesome piece of OC lore you have, with context if needed.</h2><p>The RS gang all have a gemstone made by Claire, it's a sumbol of friendship and possibly provides a protection (she's not very sure about that but maybe placebo will do it). However, For Grey and Claire's, they are made a long time ago, way back before their homes was destroyed. When Grey was sick, Claire often shows off her magic and gifts the gemstones as a way to cheer him up!</p><h2>34. Tell me one meta thing about your OC lore. Like scrapped / revamped stuff?</h2><p>Back when I first created Cosmos, because I've yet to develop a world for her, I simply imagined her in a dark, barren world with absolutely nobody. She was lonely and sad, wishing to find a company, and it stayed that way until I found an idea for a worldbuilding. This is kinda why I gave her a fear of darkness and being trapped.</p><h2>35. How do you think your OCs think of you? Are you their parent, their creation god, their suffering-bringer…</h2><p>Suffering bringer of course! I love them, but they would hate me.</p><h2>36. How much TRAUMA do you give your OCs!!</h2><p>For every trauma I have, I double it and pass it down to my OCs.</p><h2>37. Do you have a Mary Sue? Bonus points if they're your self-insert!</h2><p>The character the most Mary Sue-like is probably Cosmos. She was initially made to be my ideal self, so she used to be my self-insert as well. However, after being her more realistic personalities, and some power balancing (by making her bad at controlling her magic powers), she probably doesn't fit the definition anymore.</p><h2>38. Do you have a self-insert then? What role(s) do they play?</h2><p>I don't really have a self-insert in my OC lore, the closest thing is me entering the popularity poll comics, which is not canon. However, every OC contains a fragment of me.</p><h2>39. What are your biggest influences when it comes to OC or worldbuilding? Could be media, other people's OCs, anything.</h2><p>After looking at my OC lore, it may sound strange, but Danganronpa (V3 especially), Homestuck, Jewelpet and possibly Cookie Run have an impact in how I write my OCs.</p><h2>40. Are you happy with these influences, or would you like to break away more?</h2><p>I don't mind this influences, they are kinda funny actually, like sure what the hell.</p><h2>41. Do you try to break out of your comfort zone when coming up with new OCs and stories?</h2><p>Not sure how much is outside of my comfort zone, but there is some that hurt my ego a bit, so maybe that counts?</p><h2>42. How do you organize / categorize your OCs, if at all?</h2><p>My OCs often belong in a group, like Lavender, Cosmos, Grey, Ruth and Wolf are the main gang. They are quite easy to organise actually.</p><h2>43. Do you have any advice you would like to give to new OC creators?</h2><p>If you have no idea where to start, you can base your first OC on something you love or feel connected to.</p><h2>44. What are some boundaries you think people should have regarding other people's OCs (or things to take notice of if you create together)?</h2><p>There isn't a lot of boundaries I could think of at the moment, but remembering cringe DeviantArt era, don't call other people cringe for creating stuff I guess.</p><h2>45. How often do you think about your OCs, expressed as a percentage of your waking time?</h2><p>Not exactly 24/7 maybe 1-2 hours per day. But if I drink coffe and the caffeine hits me the right way, I would spend the whole day writing new lore.</p><h2>46. What impacts do you think your OCs had on your life?</h2><p>For one, I feel less depressed and demotivated. For two, I made this website to share their lore, which made me want to develop them even more. For three, I made Cosmos plush, which paved way for me to bond more with my friend/boyfriend.</p><h2>47. Do you want to become POPULAR? If you are already popular, what's the secret ingredient?? :eyes: :eyes:</h2><p>Mmm the current level of my "popularity" is fine.</p><h2>48. Are there any songs you think describe an OC or a story perfectly?</h2><p>I always wished Curses by The Crane Wives to fit my lore, but it feels somewhat hard to fit higher than 85%. There's also Past the Stargazing Season by H△G, I will tone down the romance stuff in canon, but Jaspers' dynamic with Claire may be quite important to the lore progression. I lowkey feel Human by FLAVORY FOLEY fits Cosmos with the motif of space and defying your inital purpose.</p><h2>49. Might you have a paracosm? Look it up!</h2><p>My brain isn't very active in dreaming about my OC world, so I wouldn't call it a paracosm?</p><h2>50. Finally, do you still recognize the word "OC" after seeing it so much?</h2><p>OC never seemed like a word ever since I entered the artsy side of Internet.</p><p class="date">( 22 Jan 2026 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
