I really hate to bother anyone, so my method of venting is usually typing how I feel on search engine. The way it (theoretically) works is that it will show posts of people having a similar experience as me, and commenters may have some good suggestions that could help me.</p><p>While this method can help me understand why I'm feeling this way, it in fact does NOT help me feel better. Many of the results I saw are often just:</p><h2>"I'm feeling miserable because of xxx"</h2><ul><li>No response (Damn...)</li><li>"Just do more exercise, do mindfulness and get therapy" (Therapy is expensive, exercise isn't that effective, and mindfulness could only do so much)</li><li>"I have been feeling the same for 30 years. Everyone in my life hurts me, my life keeps going downhill, nothing is worth it in my life." (Bro sorry to hear that but I can't feel better about this)</li></ul><p>Because of that, every time I try to use this method, I end up feeling more miserable than I already am. So lately, I've been trying to reduce venting on search engines, and that's when I notice how little safety measures I have for managing my mental health. I really want to learn more venting methods, but I don't want to search that online, I'll just get hit by the same responses I've mentioned.</p><p>I feel like the best way for me to get better is to open up to people, which brings up my big problem of shutting myself away. I always had the feeling that I'm too sensitive and weak (TBH I am called that way by many people throughout my life), and talking about my fears and sadness makes me feel like I'm a burden.</p><p>But do the people I care about actually feel this way? Recently, I became extremely distressed after watch a scene that reminded me of my past, it wasn't the worst PTSD attack I've had, but I was crying harder than I expected. My sister seemed to understand why I'm so paranoid, and came to comfort me. I have been thinking about that day, it actually made me feel better that she didn't call me anything negative and actually helped me.</p><p>I don't exactly feel safe to mention everything bad in my life to the people I love, but I think I should learn to trust them more. My brain keeps telling a lie that nobody loves me, but one thing I know is that shutting myself away is the worst thing I can do. So yea, I should chat with my friends more.</p><p class="date">( 16 Jan 2026 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
