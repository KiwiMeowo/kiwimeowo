While using them too much might slow down the site, there are just so many stuff I want to do, I couldn't stop adding new JS code!</p><p>But it turns out, my naive eyes have been neglecting a powerful tool, which is CSS.</p><hr><p>I regularly browse the <a href="https://forum.melonland.net/" target="_blank">Melonland Forum</a>, I wouldn't say I frequently post there, but I enjoy seeing other indie web doing their own thing, or even comment on posts I feel related to!</p><p>Recently, I came across this post called <a href="https://forum.melonland.net/index.php?topic=4975.msg49069#msg49069" target="_blank">"What features do you add to make your website more interactive?"</a>, as a webmaster who wants to add more cool gimmicks, I clicked to look for any cool ideas. And one reply caught my eye in particular: which is <a href="https://forum.melonland.net/index.php?topic=4975.msg47926#msg47926">Dan Q's dressup menu</a>. He uses svg format for the character images so that the colors can be changed using CSS variables, and the coolest of all? It uses no Javascript whatsoever!</p><p>My jaw dropped when I heard about this. The trick to this is using the :has() psuedo-selector, which I thought didn't exist. This selector selects elements which contain a certain element/selector, which operators like "+", ">", "," can't do. I'm bad at explaining stuff so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/:has">here's a guide</a>. Early on in my HTML coding journey, I did wish to look for this type of selector so that a rule can activate when an element contains something, but my searches yielded no results, so I assumed it did not exist. Well I was very wrong!</p><p>Back to the No-JS thing, the way it works is by using input buttons and the :checked psuedo-selector. When a button is checked, a CSS rule can be set like this:</p><pre>
  body:has(.radio:checked){--variable:white;}
  body:has(.radio2:checked){--variable:yellow;}
  body:has(.radio3:checked){--variable:blue;}
</pre><p>By using this, the variable changes depending on the button checked, no JS involved! Having this new knowledge, I went to improve some of my code:</p><ul><li>The theme toggler in my index page mostly relies on CSS now</li><li>The flip cards in the OC section is 100% CSS</li><li>(To be done) Make the song section windows 100% CSS</li></ul><p>I also had the idea to make the art gallery pages toggleable using CSS only, but I couldn't find a way to make it that it won't cause me 5 layers of pain everytime I add a new page.</p><p>I'm not sure how much it changes aside from flexing my new knowledge of CSS, but it might be better, somehow?</p><p class="date">( 9 Jan 2026 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
