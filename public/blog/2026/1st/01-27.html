But bro 2 days isn't enough to prepare.</p></div><div class="bloginfo"><div class="blogtags">Tags: Review, Game</div><div class="blogwords">523 words (2 min read)</div></div><p>Somewhat recently, I came across some videos of Wobbledogs, a game where you breed and feed wobbledogs and get interesting characteristics. I enjoy this type of game, and it just so happened that there's a sale on Steam, so I purchased the game.</p><hr><h2>Basic gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay is quite simple, at the beginning you have some default eggs to hatch normal wobbledogs, then you feed them various food to give them cool characteristics. For example, nutritional pellets give them the 0x1042 flora, and this flora gives them orange coloring and long legs. Each food has different flora, so you can try all the food and see what happens to them. When they grow into an adult, they sometimes lay eggs, allowing you to breed two adults and get a fertilized egg, which can be put into an incubator, then the cycle continues.</p><p>Honestly, if you want to breed dogs and get the coolest characteristics, you just want to go nuts. In order to get the really special characteristics, like wings, missing/extra legs, tails etc, you need to give them the food with random mutation flora. Poop, dog cocoons, dog carcass etc give them random mutations, maybe they will get some extra cool stuff after hatching or breeding.</p><hr><h2>My impressions</h2><p>This game is quite luck-based, as the random mutations are <mark>random</mark>, even if I want to get two-headed dogs, these can only appear randomly in the breeding mode. But to be honest, I don't mind RNG, I enjoy exploring my choices and collecting cool-looking dogs... However, the life cycle of dogs can be quite long, it takes almost an hour to get a dog from baby to adulthood. I really wished it can be sped up like the Sims, it can be a bit boring to slowly wait for the dogs to be old enough.</p><p>But what's difficult to bear is how dumb the dogs can be. Sometimes when I order the dogs to eat, they sometimes say they are trying to eat it, but they don't grab the food! Or maybe they are midway eating it, but get distracted and starts bouncing around. They also don't take care of themselves very well, they would starve or not sleep, like bro there are food all around you, do I have to remind you to eat and sleep everytime?</p><p>The controls are also quite annoying, it's very difficult to move around and view the map. When I open decor mode (IDK what it's called), it sometimes doesn't select the room I want to edit, and I have to exit decor mode, enter the room I want to edit either by selecting a dog in there or via tunnels, then click decor mode again. And when I want to drag items or dogs, the cursor speed becomes very slow compared to your cursor movement, and occassionally the cursor would have already moved outside of the game window, and I still hasn't dragged the item to where I wanted.</p><p>But all that aside, it is a fun game to play. I'm trying to unlock everything without using wobbledog codes, it might take a while tho.</p><h2 style="text-align:center">Rating: 7/10</h2><p class="date">( 27 Jan 2026 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
