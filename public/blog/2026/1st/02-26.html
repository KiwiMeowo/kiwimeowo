I consider myself a good sleeper, I fall asleep quite easily most of the times, and even able to sleep in less familiar environments. And sometimes, I sleep better outside of my bed! And really, I'd rather sleep on the floor than to spend 6 hours awake in the dark hours.</p><hr><h2>Me vs Can't eep</h2><p>Younger me had a better sleeping habit than I currently do, I often sleep at 12am ish, lately I have been falling asleep at 2am, which I'm trying to fix, but young me goes to sleep at 10pm sharp. I wouldn't say sleeping early helped me a lot in primary school, as I often fall asleep in class anyways, but I feel like it contributed to a better sleep cycle, because I don't remember having a lot of insomnia back then.</p><p>I remember the first time I had insomnia, when I was just a little baby (I shockingly remember some memories being a baby/toddler), I kept crying because I couldn't sleep, I wanted someone to come comfort me but nobody came. And the next time I had trouble sleeping is when I was in primary school, nothing much special was coming up, and yet my brain struggled to shift to dream land. I thought I was dying, and started to have emotional flashbacks of my friends...</p><p>After I graduated from secondary school, I started to have way more trouble sleeping, likely because I kept procrastinating from sleep. If I often sleep at late hours, I am more likely to fail to fall asleep at 'earlier' hours (as in 11pm-12am). Other factors that can affect my sleep quality are:</p><ul><li>Mosquitoes</li><li>Someone snoring</li><li>Room being too hot/stuffy</li><li>My brain being too active</li></ul><p>Fortunately, gaining experience from my insomnia, I have gathered some knowledge on how to fall asleep. First of all, I can just move to another room to sleep. My second ideal place to fall asleep in aside from my bed is the living room, not only is there a sofa, the living room is more well-ventilated than my bedroom. The third option is the computer room, there's no big seats so I often resort to sleeping on the floor, which doesn't sound as bad as you may think. I can just lay a blanket on the floor, then cushion myself using my thigh and arm. And with how cool the floor is (I prefer sleeping in a cool environment), I fall asleep quite fast! I occasionally chooses the master bedroom if my dad isn't at home as a last resort, but it often isn't available, since it's my dad's room.</p><p>If I couldn't find an ideal room, such as my sister being annoyed for me causing too much noise, or every room doesn't feel great, I would return to my own room. Another thing that might improve my sleep is to play some noise, like relaxing music or ambience. I used to play OMORI soundtracks, but now I prefer sounds like sea waves or white noises.</p><hr><h2>Damn I can't sleep</h2><p>Lately, I'm having trouble sleeping due to my air-con making too much noise. As spring is coming, the heat is coming back, I have to keep the room cool to successfully fall asleep. But recently I've been noticing my air-con making weird noise, which I would describe it being similar to a geiger meter. I think this noise has always been here, but either my brain has been filtering it out in the past, or it has been becoming louder.</p><p>Anyways, I now have to wear my noise-cancelling headphones to sleep because of that. I've found a ambient noise making app, which helps me cover up most noises from the air-con. Still, I wish I don't have to wear my headphones to sleep, as it is quite big and obstructs me from sleeping sideways. I just gotta wait for the air-con to be fixed...</p><p class="date">( 26 Feb 2026 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
