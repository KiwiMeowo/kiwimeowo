While I got scared when I first got them, but I quickly knew it isn't a big deal, and I can (mostly) go on my day normally.</p><p>My classmates seemed to view periods as a gross thing, well honestly they view anything sex is gross. When a classmates asks for pads, they pass it around like the pads are drugs or something. While I wouldn't show off pads like confetti, I feel like they should be viewed like something bad, it's just kinda like tissue paper with a more specific purpose.</p><p>A bit more I wanna talk about the sex eduaction, I feel like it can be done better, as they never mentioned anything about the period blood being more than just liquid. While textbooks always say you'd have blood coming out of you during period, I think it is just as important to mention that there's also chunks of flesh coming out as well. It makes sense as period is the uterine lining falling out, but the fact it is only depicted with just blood is misleading. When I saw the chucks of flesh, it disturbed me A LOT. And when I searched online, somehow Google told me I might have miscarriaged before it gave me results about the uterine lining, bro I never got laid. So yea, period blood has meat sometimes.</p><h2>Pain, a lot of pain</h2><p>I consider myself quite lucky as the period pain isn't too bad, at least most of the time. When I was younger, period pain isn't very common, the only thing that affects me bodily is the sleepiness, I would have to take a nap during the first and second days of my period. Period pain got more common when I reached adulthood, but the pain is usually forgettable when I'm concentrating on something else. The worst period pain I had was me sitting on the toilet for 30 minutes because it gave me stomach pain, but it only happens 20% of the time so it's no big deal, I think.</p><p>People on the Internet sometimes goes like "Oh your girlfriend is mad at you today? She must be on her period lmao". First of all, I hate it, it always sound condescending. Second of all, I was quite confused about it, as I tend to get mood fluctuations before my period, not during it, well I guess the affect varies person to person. To some degree, I feel it's not me who's being sad, it's my luck becoming bad when my period is about to come. The worst instance I remember is when my friend broke up with me for something stupid, me crying that time isn't because of my period, it's my life actually being awful to me!</p><h2>Blood stains</h2><p>To be honest, I don't think the pain is the worst thing that's happened to me, as I said they aren't too terrible to me. The worst thing has to be the blood stains, I hate it. During the first few days of my period, there is a high chance my blood will leak out of my pants. If I lay down on somewhere, or just sitting on the chair not so properly, there will be blood stains waiting for me to clean.</p><p>It's not a big problem if it's at home (still hate it when I have to clean my bed sheets), but when it's outside, it's PAIN. I was incredibly lucky I never got blood stains on my uniform when I was in secondary school, but I wasn't so lucky in university. There were times when I was in class, then I would feel something off, then realise that my period had come. And when I went to the toilet to check, yup blood is everywhere. And the worst thing? I wouldn't have anything to replace my pants, I just have to hide it awkwardly using my side bag. There was one time I did remember to wear pads, but blood leaked anyways because I forgot to take off one of the paper on the sticky side, never underestimate my clumsiness.</p><p>Gladly I don't often get accidents outside, but I still hate it when I woke up to blood staind on bed sheets. I used to wear extra long pads at night, but it wasn't very effective as it can still leak from the sides. Fortunately, there's a thing called period pants, it's like diapers but specifically for periods, it's extremely helpful when you want to sleep peacefully without worrying blood coming out. The downside is that it isn't very comfortable to wear, it feels kinda damp and can get ichy.</p><h2>Period records</h2><p>Anyways, if you experience periods like me, do you keep track of your period dates? Back when my periods started, I didn't feel the need to keep track of them. But after I got ITP and have to regularly visit the hospital for checkups, I need to note down my dates to give the doctor my period info. I downloaded an app that keeps track and predicts my period dates, would I say it's accurate? Mostly I guess, it might not exactly get the date right, but it always reminds me when the predicted period date is close.</p><hr><p>Ramble end, I goota hang my clothes.</p><p class="date">( 10 Feb 2026 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
