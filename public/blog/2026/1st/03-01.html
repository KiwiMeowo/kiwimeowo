I actually think she wasn't harsh enough, I should delve deeper.</p><hr><h2>Shows</h2><p>In terms of shows, I generally see romance subplots as a warning that this show won't be my thing- Well to be more precise, when I see the male protagonist meeting a suspiciously-conventionally-attractive female main character, I know these two will eventually development some form of romantic love, and I don't like that. Luckily, the love interest usually appear very early in shows, so I will save a lot of time and just skip it. I remember watching an anime where a girl tried to kill the main character, but the protag defeats her. When the protag got the chance to kill her, I was like "Yesss, kill her so that there will be no chance for some dumb romance subplot...", unfortunately he spared her. Damn it, the show was kinda interesting from what I remembered.</p><p>However, some romance subplot might come up mid-way through the way. I watched a thriller that I kinda enjoyed, but half-way through a main character falls in love with another main character. Like sure, the investigations are still fun to watch but now I had to endure like one corny romantic scene every episode. And in the ending, the twist was that one of them is the murderer, and the other guy is assisting her... I know it's my bias talking but GOD WAS. I. MAD!</p><hr><h2>Games</h2><p>I realised I never really played games that allows you to romance characters. I'm usually the ones that do the matchmaking, like in Sims, Tomodachi Life, and if we count breeding stuff, Wobbledogs and those old pet-management games also. The only one that has the romance characters mechanic I remember playing is Stardew Valley, which I mentioned I wasn't a big fan of.</p><p>Because of my lack of experience in playing games, what I'm gonna say might not be true, but it is an ongoing worry: I'm worried that by not romancing characters will make me miss out on stuff. What I know about Stardew Valley is that after you marry a character, they will give you some unique rewards. It sounds good for those who do want to marry a character, but what about those who don't? Do they just not get anything? While I can just ignore the romance mechanic, I have a sense of FOMO that just makes me feel bitter. It might be an overreaction, but it feels like a punishment for wanting to be aro and/or ace (Girl who's too woke).</p><p>Again, I might be wrong and these might not actually happen. If that's the case, feel free to correct me!</p><hr><h2>Real Life Romance</h2><p>Some people I know often mistake me for a hater for anything romance, it's a common mistake, obviously as I'm dating with someone now. When I read someone talking about their love stories, it feels heart-warming.</p><p>And I actually lowkey interested in listening to other's experience in love. In anime, the girls always discuss love and guessing each other's crushes. While I don't wish to have my thoughts and mind torn apart in a truth-or-dare like a group of wolves eating their prey, I do wish to have an open-minded sharing on how it's like to be in love. But alas, many people make fun of people having crushes.</p><hr><p>I'm still not sure why I hate romance in fiction so much, I assume fictional romance tends to be too dramatic (since stories are meant to be dramatic), and as someone who prefers the thriller, lore moments in stories, I hate it when the romance gets in the way of lore.</p><p class="date">( 1 Mar 2026 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
