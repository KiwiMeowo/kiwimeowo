But because of privacy reasons and you already know most of the info, I'm going to reply with the funny answer of "3000/Your mom/In your house".</p><ol start="3"><li>opinions on musicals?</li></ol><p>I really like Hamilton and Ride the Cyclone, but it can get a bit awkward and annoying if you add musicals to visual novels (flashback to Wicked Cookie Run collab).</p><ol start="4"><li>favorite snack?</li></ol><p>Used to be addicted to the Kinder Bueno White Chocolate Bar. I also loved a cheese flavored rice cracker which brand I've forgotten, I had to restrict myself from buying them because I KNOW I would eat them all in one setting. I also love the HOURAKU Cheese Bouchee from Châteraisé... Well you can check out my <a href="/food.html">food page</a> if you wanna know more.</p><ol start="5"><li>have u ever been in love?</li></ol><p>Yuh</p><ol start="6"><li>favorite pokemon?</li></ol><p>Sadly I don't play Pokemon</p><ol start="7"><li>mario kart main?</li></ol><p>Don't play that either (Unless I'm visiting my relative's house, but I don't have a main).</p><ol start="8"><li>tf2 main?</li></ol><p>I don't play that too</p><ol start="9"><li>do you laugh at youtube poops?</li></ol><p>I have horrible low level humor, I laugh die everytime.</p><ol start="10"><li>are you listening to music right now?</li></ol><p>Unfortunately no, but I will definitely play Oz. by Yama later.</p><ol start="11"><li>favorite shape?</li></ol><p>The five-pointed star I suppose?</p><ol start="12"><li>do you believe in astrology?</li></ol><p>Not really, believing stars and planets can affect your personality seems weird. But I really like space and stars themselves, like wow giant rocks and objects beyond my comprehension...</p><ol start="13"><li>do you believe in the occult?</li></ol><p>Not really</p><ol start="14"><li>opinions on vocaloid?</li></ol><p>I used to be obsessed with watching every single Vocaloid video I encounter. Now I watch them less, but there are still some Vocaloid songs I love, especially the ones made by FLAVOR FOLEY.</p><ol start="15"><li>would you ever want to be a rockstar?</li></ol><p>Not really, crowd scares me.</p><ol start="16"><li>do you easily get stressed?</li></ol><p>Yea, one moment I'd be fine, and once a minor inconvenience lands on me, I'd crash out.</p><ol start="17"><li>what is/was your favorite class in high school?</li></ol><p>If I ignore the high school part, and put both senior and junior years of secondary school into account, I'd say Home Economics and Design & Technology. The former one teaches sewing and cooking, the latter is crafting useful things like boxes and moving paper figurines. They are so fun, but they are exclusive to year 1 to 3, it felt like I lost a life motivation after I moved to senior year...</p><ol start="18"><li>what pokemon type would you be? dual types are allowed lol</li></ol><p>I know a little bit about Pokemon types... Maybe Normal.</p><ol start="19"><li>rei or asuka?</li></ol><p>I assume the characters from Neon Genesis Evangelion, uhh I don't know enough about these characters to have a preference.</p><ol start="20"><li>favorite html tag?</li></ol><p><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>.</p><ol start="21"><li>are you religious?</li></ol><p>Due to personal reasons, I have a non-serious belief that if god do exist, they are probably not good.</p><ol start="22"><li>opinions on nightcore?</li></ol><p>It's a good option if you are starting to find the songs you like are getting old.</p><ol start="23"><li>did you go through any major phase? (emo, goth, weeaboo, etc)</li></ol><p>There was a weaboo phase... But it's more of a mentality than actual weaboo hobbies since I didn't watch a lot of anime to begin with.</p><ol start="24"><li>are you good at drawing?</li></ol><p>Well, I draw.</p><ol start="25"><li>do you crack your joints?</li></ol><p>No, I'm so bad at cracking them that I would feel my knuckles half-cracked, and I hate that feeling.</p><ol start="26"><li>do you read visual novels?</li></ol><p>Cookie Run I guess.</p><ol start="27"><li>can you sew?</li></ol><p>I made my Cosmos plush, so I assume yea.</p><ol start="28"><li>can you cook?</li></ol><p>I can cook rice, cook baby cabbages, scrambled eggs and chicken wings. I can also barbeque stuff.</p><ol start="29"><li>most expensive thing you've bought?</li></ol><p>My table bed, but my sister did sponsor half of the money.</p><ol start="30"><li>opinions on cosplay?</li></ol><p>Tried that once, it's fun but quite exhausting.</p><ol start="31"><li>what's your most hated band/musician?</li></ol><p>Don't have one.</p><ol start="32"><li>are you a dramatic person?</li></ol><p>Not sure</p><ol start="33"><li>what emoticon do you use most?</li></ol><p>😔</p><ol start="34"><li>can a miracle certainly occur?</li></ol><p>Yea, given enough time, a monkey might even type the entirety of shakespeare, or something.</p><ol start="35"><li>would you let a vampire suck ur blood?</li></ol><p>It depends. Does it turn me into a vampire? If not, I will let them, only on the wrist.</p><ol start="36"><li>do you have a celebrity crush?</li></ol><p>I only have fictional crushes, I find it weird to have crush on real life popular people.</p><ol start="37"><li>do you like snow?</li></ol><p>As a person living in somewhere that doesn't snow, hell yes.</p><ol start="38"><li>were you really into greek mythology as a kid?</li></ol><p>I don't even know what is Greek mythology that time.</p><ol start="39"><li>what are some things you could competently deliver a speech on?</li></ol><p>Probably the Cookie Run lore, but mind you I stutter a lot.</p><ol start="40"><li>are you good at spelling?</li></ol><p>If I focus, maybe.</p><ol start="41"><li>which touhou wud u fuk?</li></ol><p>I don't know Touhou enough to have a sexual interest in any of the characters. (I don't have sexual interests in fictional characters actually)</p><ol start="42"><li>do you think there's going to be a robot takeover?</li></ol><p>Not likely.</p><ol start="43"><li>HAS SCIENCE GONE TOO FAR??!?!??!?!</li></ol><p>Before cat girls are a thing, no.</p><ol start="44"><li>would you be an angel or devil?</li></ol><p>Yes</p><ol start="45"><li>sine, cosine, or tangent?</li></ol><p>Shoot them all down with a gun</p><ol start="46"><li>do you like licorice?</li></ol><p>Never had licorice actually.</p><ol start="47"><li>whats one thing you cant stand that everyone else loves?</li></ol><p>Romance subplots.</p><ol start="48"><li>what books did you like as a kid?</li></ol><p>The Garfeild comics</p><ol start="49"><li>can you play any instruments?</li></ol><p>I've only played the recorder before, mandatory by the school. Aside from that, I kinda tried to play the instruments in Sky: COTL, if that counts.</p><ol start="50"><li>what song would you want to play at your wedding?</li></ol><p>I don't know, maybe something hype, I'm not sure what suits a wedding. Actually, do I even have a choice in what kind of wedding I have? I heard that you have to invite ALL your close relatives, and as someone who dislikes relatives, this is quite a bad news. But I heard people say we can't disrespect this "tradition" because our ancestors also did that whenever they want it or not. I don't know this generational trauma is true, but I figured if I would get married, I won't have much freedom until I leave this family. Say, why do I have to see relatives anyways, they always overstep my boundaries, then scold me for reacting badly to that. God I hate this-</p><p>Oh right I'm still answering a questionaire.</p><ol start="51"><li>do you believe in reincarnation?</li></ol><p>I honestly doubt that. While I stopped believe in the cult I was in, one thing I believe is that fact when we die, we won't have a soul floating around, just eternal sleep.</p><ol start="52"><li>finish the sentence: I'm just a guy/girl who ______</li></ol><p>draws. (Oh wait isn't this how I write bios?)</p><ol start="53"><li>have you been to another continent?</li></ol><p>No. But one day if I have time to go to a Crane Wives or Will Wood concert, maybe I will get this achievement.</p><ol start="54"><li>whats your worst habit?</li></ol><p>Daydreaming about bad stuff happening to me. A form of intrusive though I believe.</p><ol start="55"><li>favorite vegetable?</li></ol><p>Baby cabbage, garlic, onions.</p><ol start="56"><li>whats something stupid that scared the shit outta you as a kid?</li></ol><p>I used to be scared of horror movies and gore, but I wouldn't call that stupid. A stupid one has to be my water heater at home, that is stupid indeed, problem is I'm still scared of it.</p><ol start="57"><li>whats one of your guilty pleasures?</li></ol><p>Eating seasoning and spreading on its own. Fun fact, I also ate raw minced beef just because my mouth was bored, luckily didn't get food poisoning from that.</p><ol start="58"><li>would you rather be a ghost or a vampire?</li></ol><p>Ghosts probably have more freedom to move around, so ghost it is.</p><ol start="59"><li>what do you fear most?</li></ol><p>Being hurt again.</p><ol start="60"><li>do you sleep with any plushies?</li></ol><p>Always.</p><ol start="61"><li>what hobby do you just not understand?</li></ol><p>There's probably more that I couldn't understand, but the only one I remember is Rubik's Cube. After I realise Rubik's Cube is just memorising a sequence, it felt less fun.</p><ol start="62"><li>do you like the taste of alcohol?</li></ol><p>I don't like bitter alcohol, like beer. But I've drank some really tasty cocktail, it's mango flavored with a layer of cream cheese, would get drunk by it 10/10</p><ol start="63"><li>are you a hopeless romantic?</li></ol><p>Not really?</p><ol start="64"><li>which deadly sin best fits you?</li></ol><p>While many would disagree, I somewhat feel wrath fits my inner mind.</p><ol start="65"><li>which of your physical features do you like the most?</li></ol><p>I don't know if I like any parts the most, but I look alright in general. If I had to pick one, probably my hair?</p><ol start="66"><li>are your ears pierced?</li></ol><p>No, I heard you have to place the pins in the ear hole to prevent it from healing, which sounds annoying.</p><ol start="67"><li>have you ever been in a physical fight?</li></ol><p>Well I've been beaten up that one time, but I'll spare the trauma-dumping.</p><ol start="68"><li>where do you buy your clothes?</li></ol><p>I used to shop at Uniquo, but for prettier clothings, I go to a store which sells female clothing with larger size, because I often have trouble finding pretty clothes that fit me.</p><ol start="69"><li>where would you live if you could live anywhere?</li></ol><p>I feel anywhere will have a downside, maybe stuff is expensive and political stuff. Realisticly, I'll stay in Hong Kong until my family finds a better place. Unrealistically, Okinawa, I miss there.</p><ol start="70"><li>do believe in magic? or is it all a trick?</li></ol><p>I honestly doubt magic is real, but if it's real, whatever magic familiar out there, a college student is wishing to fly and punch monsters (waves hand).</p><ol start="71"><li>have you read umineko when they cry? you should!</li></ol><p>Haven't read that but seems interesting.</p><ol start="72"><li>what is the worst chore to do?</li></ol><p>Washing dishes, followed by folding clothes.</p><ol start="73"><li>what did your parents almost name you?</li></ol><p>Not sure really.</p><ol start="74"><li>what would you want your name to be if you were not your current gender?</li></ol><p>For my Chinese name (the legal name), it sounds somewhat feminine, but it will be fine if I just swap the feminine sound character to a more masc one. For my real life English nickname (HKers use English nicknames for everyday use, like 加明 might use Kevin or smth), it sounds gender neutral, so no need to change. For my online name Kiwi, while it sounds very cute, it really depends on the alternate universe me to decide if it's too feminine or if he's fine with being cute. But if I'm a guy right now, I'm fine with being Kiwi.</p><ol start="75"><li>what were your first words?</li></ol><p>"Mom" I think, very normal.</p><ol start="76"><li>what do you want your last words to be?</li></ol><p>If I'm happy with my life, "I love you" to the people I love the most.</p><p>If I had a hard and depressing life, "Go to hell" to everyone except the people I love.</p><ol start="77"><li>when did you first regularly start going online?</li></ol><p>I think it was in fourth grade, I had an Ipad and started browsing Youtube unsupervised. Ending up seeing a lot of gore animations.</p><ol start="78"><li>what year do you miss the most?</li></ol><p>Around 2015, the final years of primary school. While it was like hell that I got bullied, I still have a beloved friend and crush that helped me go through everyday. My life now is way better than that time, but sometimes I reminisce the time I hang out with him...</p><p>Why am I missing that time anyways, I'm literally dating him right now.</p><ol start="79"><li>are you psychic?</li></ol><p>OooOoOoO I'm reading your brain right now.</p><ol start="80"><li>would you fuck a clone of yourself? you're not allowed to kill yourself.</li></ol><p>While some people see the appeal, as nobody understands your body better than yourself. However, I think I'd be repulsed by my own appearance, so no.</p><ol start="81"><li>what do you use to listen to music?</li></ol><p>Apple Music or Youtube, either with headphones or just blast the music through speakers.</p><ol start="82"><li>whats the biggest city you've been to?</li></ol><p>Guangzhou apparently.</p><ol start="83"><li>favorite animal?</li></ol><p>Hampter</p><ol start="84"><li>what web browser do you use?</li></ol><p>Firefox</p><ol start="85"><li>are you allergic to kitty cats???????????</li></ol><p>Nope, been to cat cafes and came out fine!</p><ol start="86"><li>do you like energy drinks?</li></ol><p>Never drank them, but I'd probably die considering how caffeine often gives me bad insomnia.</p><ol start="87"><li>would ever spend money on tf2 unusuals/csgo skins/gacha pulls/etc</li></ol><p>I'd only spend money if it's a good deal, like HKD$6 for a package full of crystals and gacha pull currency.</p><ol start="88"><li>when do you usually go to bed?</li></ol><p>If I'm diligent, 11pm. Or else, 12-1am. Or worse, 2am. Any time later than that means I've got insomnia.</p><ol start="89"><li>how often do you wash your hair?</li></ol><p>Bi-daily, my hair turns greasy somewhat quickly.</p><ol start="90"><li>would you download a car?</li></ol><p>Hell yeah (What do I do with a car?)</p><ol start="91"><li>what was your favorite show as a kid?</li></ol><p>It has to be Jewelpet, it probably rewired my brain in a strange way.</p><ol start="92"><li>whats the silliest hat you own?</li></ol><p>I don't often wear hats, but I have a cat ear hat.</p><ol start="93"><li>what album/song do you're feeling angsty</li></ol><p>The Crane Wives: Scars. Will Wood: Cicada Days.</p><ol start="94"><li>do you make OCs?</li></ol><p>Ehem, yes.</p><ol start="95"><li>whats the goofiest thing you do when completely alone?</li></ol><p>Playing Ring Fit Adventure, which doesn't sound that goofy.</p><ol start="96"><li>do you like fireworks?</li></ol><p>Maybe?</p><ol start="97"><li>favorite painter?</li></ol><p>I don't have one in mind.</p><ol start="98"><li>favorite numbers?</li></ol><p>3 is my lucky number.</p><ol start="99"><li>what genre of vidya gaems are you really good at? (fps, fightan, danmaku, racing, whatever.</li></ol><p>I wouldn't say there's one I'm good at. I used to able to play Cookie Run Ovenbreak Trophy Race half-asleep, but that's in the past.</p><ol start="100"><li>time and date you finished this?</li></ol><p>2026-01-21 17:11. Well it's nice I completed it before sunset.</p><p class="date">( 21 Jan 2026 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
