So as we were standing in the elevator, a group of people in scary costumes went inside. And after the elevator moved to a lower floor, the group of people left, except for three scary-looking kids, they look like <a href="https://youtu.be/ooHiFoWz50U?si=0sOmJ_HaVQzZHSj9" target="_blank">this ghost kid that speaks random Japanese words in that horror movie</a>.</p><p><a href="https://kiwimeowo.neocities.org/blog/2026/1st/02-05.html">...Continue reading</a></p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2>Goofy dogs and unethical breeding practises</h2><p>Somewhat recently, I came across some videos of Wobbledogs, a game where you breed and feed wobbledogs and get interesting characteristics. I enjoy this type of game, and it just so happened that there's a sale on Steam, so I purchased the game.</p><p><a href="https://kiwimeowo.neocities.org/blog/2026/1st/01-27.html">...Continue reading</a></p>]]></description>
