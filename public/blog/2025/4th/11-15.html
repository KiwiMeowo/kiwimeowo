But first, a dream that may or may not be related to Cosmos, and what dream is better than a thriller where I nearly died in a collapsing building?</p><h2>A thriller</h2><p>So the dream started out with me and my family visiting relatives. We were chilling in their apartment normally, until we saw an air ship flying in the sky. "That's strange", one of us said, "I thought these weren't legal in Hong Kong". I felt somewhat uneasy about how close the airship was to us, what if it crashed into us? So I went into another room which I think would be safer(really bad call as the room is further away from the apartment exit), well color me shocked, it crashed into the room right about I entered, barely scraping past me.</p><p>All of us stood dumbfounded for a few seconds, an airship sudddenly appeared, then it nearly killed us... Yea we have to run. Right before leaving, I still decided to take me important belongings: My phone, my wallet, and my Cosmos plush.</p><p>So we speedily went down the stairs, and we saw a lot of people in the stairway as well. The floor labels were very confusing and likely to be mislabelled, so many people stood at a place that might be on the ground floor, unsure where to go. There was a door to a lower floor, so some people (including me) thought it would be safer. However, one of the relatives stopped me, saying it was too dangerous. I was confused why, then the basement suddenly exploded. Apparently that was the electric room, I was very disturbed by the fact the people who went there just got killed.</p><p>Anyways, we found the exit to outside, but we were told to not go outside in fear the building would collapse on us. In the final moments before the building collapsed, we stayed in the ground floor and ducked. The ground was shaking and debris where flying everywhere, we were all terrified of being separated. But at the end, we survived.</p><p>So at the end, despite the shit we went through, we went to get some snacks, and went home by train. I also developed a fear of stairs, I don't know where that came from, I just knew it caused a lot of inconvenience going to places.</p><p>However, one thing I was thankful for was I had most of my important things with me. Many things were destroyed and lost in the building, but I still had my Cosmos plush with me.</p><p>When I woke up, I told my friend about this dream, and he said Cosmos plush protected me. So uh, thank you Cosmos &lt;3</p><hr><p>So back to the discussion of Cosmos. I think the idea of sharing new special lore of my OC on their birthdays is bit too high ambition. Ever since my internship, I feel my creativity has dropped a lot. However, I can talk about more of my ideas for her.</p><p>So I might have mentioned this, but the initial concept of Cosmos is my ideal personality, a brave and strong traveller who isn't afraid to meet new people. But over the years, she became a half magical creature, half human.</p><p>Currently, the main thing of Cosmos is that she isn't exactly sure what she wants to do and become: Complete her inital mission to save the world, or find a new solution to protect everyone; A cometling who acts as a sidekick, or a new hero who steps in to change the story.</p><p>Cometlings can't use their own magic, and has to rely on another human to use it. But Cosmos now can use her magic, and in a team where everyone's magic has some special limitations, Cosmos does need to use it sometimes. Being unfamiliar with her powers, it often causes unwanted chaos, just like Ruby from Jewelpet season 1, who has a 50% of exploding when she uses her power.</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/epqcutn25ftb89dvkkyz4/vote6p4.jpg?rlkey=sb80dnavoj35ev9jbsytm8jla&st=m0uejnem&raw=1"><center>Dumbass</center><p>Aside from not understanding how to use magic, the story of how she obtained her human form was somewhat disturbing to her, adding to more unstability to her magic.</p><p>That's why I call her "Magic cat girl with identity crisis" in the sitemap, poor girl has to figure out what she should do whilst the world is ending.</p><p>But the good thing is that she is not alone in her journey, her friends are also struggling with their internal problems, and are supporting each other, intentionally or not, especially Lavender, Cosmos' first friend when she first woke up. While Lavender acted distant, Cosmos managed to learn from her that not everything is set in stone (And Lavender isn't aware of this either). There is nothing better than seeing characters getting development after learning from others.</p><p>In most of my art, I always draw Cosmos as a silly car :3. While that is true, Cosmos is also a adventurous warrior who would protect her friends when the sky is crumbling down, and I don't think I have portrayed her that way enough. One day, I should design her a new outfit, and draw her aura farming more.</p><hr><p>Thank you for following my dumb OC stories (assuming that you are), and here is my art for Cosmos.</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/akly4djmprygl4akrwapb/IMG_5567_20251115.JPG?rlkey=9rcaov9rtbeocchg3at0lazgo&raw=1"><p class="date">( 15 Nov 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
