Sadly, we all have to go to work or school, waking up at 7 or earlier is basically unavoidable.</p><p>When I was a kid, I had a lot of trouble waking up in the morning, especially during winter. Winter days are darker, and the cold makes you want to stay in bed. However, I was always forced out of bed since, you know, school. But after I went outside of the bed, it gets easier to do things. I guess the solution to be productive is the first push.</p><p>As I got to secondary school, I had to be more independant. Perhaps I became aware that I can get late since nobody would wake me up anymore, I never overslept... aside from the few times my phone alarm didn't go off or I have mistaken the meeting time with the starting time. I got late to my first day of secondary school because I thought the school is starting one hour later!</p><p>Anyways, I was quite sleep deprived, as the amount of free time I had was limited, and I wanted to make use of the time by playing games. So during my secondary school days, when I wanted to sleep a bit longer, I have developed a sleeping method, just like this:</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/td8by35erkak62buuoyxl/poiwvnzmpkr31_2491258972_20251101.jpg?rlkey=vtd02634i5781uu0jbw70v3vy&raw=1"><p>In this pose, I can have a short nap before I go to school, and I can make sure I won't oversleep! I have never gotten late napping like this, well honestly this isn't exactly a comfortable napping method anyways.</p><p>How much do you trust your alarm? Like I have mentioned, there were several incidents where the alarm didn't go off, causing me to be late to school. So I have set two alarms for each school day, if one doesn't go off, the other will ring again. However, there is a possibility that both alarms might not go off, and adding one more alarm might be safer. On the other hand, having too turn off multiple alarms every few minutes is quite annoying, adding salt to the wound which is waking up groggy. Maybe I should invest in an actual alarm clock?</p><p>As winter is approaching, waking up will get a lot harder. Hopefully my body will adapt to the cold.</p><p class="date">( 1 Nov 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
