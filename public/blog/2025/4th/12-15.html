It's either because I overheard my sister watching this show, or I decided to watch it after seeing the entirety of Twitter watching it.</p><p>So this show is about a group of people who got trapped inside a digital circus, they all turned into cartoony characters, and is taken of of by an AI called Caine. While Caine is mostly friendly and keeps them entertained in silly adventures, nobody likes the feeling of being trapped forever, right?</p><hr><p>While I am not active in the fandom (like how I always lurk), TADC is a show that I always enjoy, and the episodes gets better with every new one. While the first episode explains the basic worldbuilding of the show, the following ones seems to establish the character personalities and relationships, which they do it very well.</p><p>At first, Pomni feels like the paranoid character who didn't know what to do. But in later episodes, she becomes calmer and is even shown to be quite emotionally intelligent, Pomni was just not used to the life of being in the circus at first.</p><p>For many episodes, Gangle's happy mask breaking is a reccuring joke. But in the Gun Episode, Gangle is able to use her happy mask and attack using her tommy gun, even when she lost, she is still smiling behind her mask. Also Gangle seems to get happier, especially when there's Zooble around. I'm not a fan of the "character keeps getting bullied/hurt as a reccuring joke" trope, so I really like how they wrote Gangle.</p><p>Despite the show's colorful and cartoony exterior, the show explores a dark theme of being tormented by an AI which doesn't understand humans for eternity. Staying inside a world away from your home is distressing enough, there's also Caine. While Caine means well, he doesn't really understand humans, and sometimes unintentionally makes the members more upset.</p><p>My favourite episode has to be the third one, where the characters explore a haunted mansion. This was the first episode where nothing majorly bad happens, no characters getting a new trauma or characters dying (Ep 2 was also very memorable and heartbreaking, RIP gummigoo). We also learnt more about Kinger, like how he thinks better in the dark and his past with his wife. We learnt that Kinger is actually really reliable despite how he acts normally, and seeing him comforting Pomni makes me so happy. I really love the sequence where Kinger glows in the dark while walking with Pomni in the alleyway.</p><hr><p>In the newest episode, the humans meets a secret human disguising as an NPC, claiming to be a developer of the circus. He said he knows a way to leave the circus, but I didn't believe he's actually named Abel. Oh like a counterpart to Caine? Like the guys from the Bible? Yeah totally. Jax also said that there's a chance Abel is just an NPC from an adventure written by Caine, and there isn't actually a way to escape. While that possibility is possible, I still held onto the possibility that they found a clue to the exit, it would be so frustrating if these are all lies, right?</p><p>During the escape, Abel was concerningly distrustful towards Kinger. He implied that Kinger did something really bad when they were working together. In contrast, Pomni and Ragatha trust Kinger a lot, during their way to getting the admin pass, the two mentioned Kinger was there with them when they are struggling with stuff in the circus. That sequence feels like Kinger's backstory will be shown more, and the bond between Kinger and the other cast will be developed more.</p><p>Throughout the show Jax has been a dickhead, especially towards Gangle. But it isn't too hard to see that his mean demeanor is just a mask to hide something from him. And after the gun episode, Jax's nonchalantness is basically non-existent, everything he does almost shows how anxious he is.</p><p>The reason why he acts this way is likely he fears to feel any emotions for potential friends, why will likely go abstract in the future. We've seen in the newest episode that Jax used to be friends with Ribbit and Kaufmo, who both has been abstracted. His way of dealing with his emotions is to repress them and act like an asshole all the time to avoid getting attached to anyone, but how long can this last?</p><p>Moreover, it's implied he has a past that he does not want to return to, we got to see his unusually childish and girly bedroom, and the glimses of his past, and he hated his past so much he pressed the red button to trap everyone in the circus forever. Luckily, the whole thing is fabricated... But wow I can't imagine what would happen if it's real. Some people say Caine caused Jax to remember his past to press the red button, and personally I thought Jax pressed it on his own. But I saw a tweet that basically says "The circus members can't even trust themselves anymore as they don't know if their thoughts are their own", which is... very terrifying.</p><hr><p>It's a really good show to look foward to, and I really love the character writing. I can't wait for the next episode to come out!</p><p class="date">( 15 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
