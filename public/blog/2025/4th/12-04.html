However, none of these games feel perfect for my cooking game needs, the customers in GPGP are harsh (I'm sensitive uHu), there isn't much options to spend the food in Animal Crossing (and eating it gives you strength to break stuff, which I don't want), and I'm all alone in Minecraft. I sometimes think if I ever know how to make a game, I want a game where I can cook without much stress, give food to nice people, and maybe even a delivery system like <a href="https://youtu.be/eihCp8j0QEk?si=cItk5DTWbAWAitkv" target="_blank">Go Go Hamster Chef!</a> (Sadly it's a short horror game, not too interested in horror).</p><p>Few days ago, I stumbled upon a video called <a href="https://youtu.be/UI_-VYuPZYk?si=yvhrs1DX1vlu1463" target="_blank">The State of Cooking Games...</a>, I didn't know what complains people have regarding cooking games, so I gave it a watch. But instead of just complaining, the video maker, TheStellarJay, mentions the pros and cons of some cooking games. And one game that caught my mind is, you guessed it: Galaxy Burger. TheStellarJay mentions:</p><blockquote><p>There are no timers, no penalties for making customers wait. If you get an order wrong, you can just remake it.</p></blockquote><p>Upon hearing that, I almost immediately headed to Steam. It's playable on Mac!!! But not the demo version, for some reason. I played the demo on the Windows computer in my home, and noticed how relaxing it is by just removing the timer. I went back to my own laptop, and bought the game.</p><hr><p>In this game, there are many planets where you can open a store in, and you can earn experience in a planet to get ingredients or new mechanics, or earn money to unlock other planets. I haven't unlocked everything, but so far there is burgers, fried stuff and drinks.</p><p>Anyways, the thing I love the most about this game is I can take my own time handling each order. Sure, there are cooking games where the time is always sufficient (I rarely run out of time in GPGP anyways), but it reduces a lot of anxiety when you don't have to worry about the potential punishment of being late.</p><p>Moreover, the customers handle getting the wrong order a lot better. If you get their order wrong a bit, you can ask the customer what parts aren't perfect, and they'll tell you where it went wrong. If you mess up the order completely (Like accidentally sending the order before you put anything in), you can either give them a refund or redo the order. Also, the customers are polite even if I mess up, probably unrealistic, but it feels less punishing and I like it.</p><p>There is also a lot of varity of burger combinations, sometimes the customers will ask for custom burgers, and some will order combinations in your menu. At the beginning, the orders are quite simple, almost boring since the patties take a while to finish cooking. But as time progresses, the orders get more complex, and it will get impossible to remember all the burger combinations. I unlocked like 7 and my brain is overloading, and there's like 80 of them if you unlock them all.</p><p>But again, if my brain is being overwhelmed, instead of rushing myself because I'm running out of time, I can just take a deep breath, look at my orders again, and do the one I'm making most progress.</p><p>(Note: I noticed there are impatient customers while reading the Steam page, I don't know exactly how it works, so I'll get back here when I get there.)</p><p>One thing that I wish to be changed is that there isn't much cosmetics to unlock. So far in this game, the money can be used to unlock planets and buy coupons (A type of bonus you can add to one day of work, e.g. Double the amount of tips). I wish there are other ways I can spend my money on, such as decorations, equipment upgrades and others.</p><hr><p>That's it for today's game review, I should go study and play again.</p><p class="date">( 4 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
