Please introduce yourself.</h2><p>Name's Kiwi, KiwiMeowo.</p><h2>2. How long have you been making websites?</h2><p>Not counting the time I made my first website during secondary school, it has been 2 years.</p><h2>3. And what got you into the hobby?</h2><p>I mentioned this multiple times in my past blogs. The story goes that my friend introduced me to Neocities after I fiddled around Carrd, I designed the website, fell in love with making websites, and the rest is history.</p><h2>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</h2><p>I enjoy blog websites, where people ramble about their life or their fixations. I also love art websites, I like seeing people's art.</p><h2>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</h2><p>There isn't much planning, when I get an idea, I think if it is feasible, and if it is, I code it.</p><h2>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</h2><p>I don't have one inspirations in particular.</p><h2>7. What's your favourite part about making websites?</h2><p>I really like the freedom of just making whatever the fuck I want. Compared to the many limitations of social media, getting to make everything just for me feels so liberating.</p><h2>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</h2><p>Decorations I guess. I'm kinda a straightforward person, and tend to skim over smaller details. I like putting together colors, but I don't like finding/making cute assets to decorate my website, it feels too time-consuming.</p><h2>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</h2><p>I enjoy consistency, so most of them look quite the same!</p><h2>10. How confident are you with CSS?</h2><p>As soon as I have my DevTools in my hands, yes. I still don't remember how to make proper flex boxes without looking up the rules though.</p><h2>11. Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?</h2><p>Wait what is this- Oh a description list, never used it before, I think.</p><h2>12. What is your favourite HTML element?</h2><p>It has to be &lt;div&gt;, it's basically a wildcard which I can abuse. &lt;kbd&gt; is kinda cute too.</p><h2>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</h2><p>I will first copy a page that matches what I need the most and use it as a template. I also have a empty template ready for use but I always forget.</p><h2>14. Do you know JavaScript?</h2><p>Yuh, it's what I have been using ever since I wanted to make my website cooler.</p><h2>15. How about PHP?</h2><p>Nope, it isn't available in Neocities, nor did I have the need to use it for the time being.</p><h2>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</h2><p>Well my website's color scheme is based off Cosmos.</p><h2>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</h2><p>Content first, then design.</p><h2>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</h2><p>I have considered, but I don't like spending money on something that I don't exactly need. But if I ever get one, I think kiwimeowo.net or kiwimeowo.art would do.</p><h2>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</h2><p>Probably because I never really explored the net other than the flash game websites when I was a kid, I don't feel much nostalgia from them. Not a lot of feelings.</p><h2>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</h2><p>Well, <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fkiwimeowo.neocities.org%2F" target="_blank">see for yourself</a>. I don't have the energy to fix all of them :P</p><h2>21. What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</h2><p>I like buttons, I can be a bit picky on saving one though. I only save the ones which websites look interesting, or if the buttons are REALLY pretty/cute (e.g. hamsters). I don't like banners as much though, they are too shiny for my taste. I really love badges, they are very tiny, I like tiny stuff.</p><h2>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</h2><p>My button wall is somewhat small, but I've seen people with lots of them. It can take a long time to load though.</p><h2>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</h2><p>The content might stay the same, but the layout might look a bit different. Since the current layout is originally a template, I might attempt to make something that looks a bit different, but theme-wise it would be the same.</p><h2>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</h2><p>Not much. There are some websites that look really amazing, but I wouldn't say I'm envious.</p><h2>25. What text editor do you use?</h2><p>VSCode</p><h2>26. Why do you use that one?</h2><p>I wanted to try out 11ty after noticing putting my blogs in collapsibles isn't a optimal idea, and to do that I need to download my files onto my laptop. And VSCode was the best editor I could think of at the time.</p><h2>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</h2><p>I use Dropbox, have been using it to archive some old photos, so I decided to use it to host my art as well.</p><h2>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</h2><p>I personally enjoy the social aspect of Neocities, but I recommend new people to use Nekoweb, since it allows stuff like status.cafe to be used.</p><h2>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</h2><p>113.04 MB! Which is funny since I checked my oldest version of my website I have, and the older one is larger than my current one.</p><h2>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</h2><p>I only have the Github repo as a backup, and some older versions. Actually maybe I should back them up now.</p><h2>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</h2><p>I really like the ones which are decorated beautifully, but I prefer if it doesn't look cluttered, I don't like it when the stuff is hard to read.</p><h2>32. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</h2><p>My website is Cosmos colored, because I love her :3</p><h2>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</h2><p>I didn't consider quitting, but there are times I've considered having an hiatus since I've been running out of stuff to post.</p><h2>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</h2><p>Like I mentioned, I got into HTML coding because of my friend. While I don't talk to other webmasters often, I did meet some cool people, like <a href="https://puddingpudd.com/" target="_blank">Pudding</a>!</p><h2>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</h2><p>Only those close to me knew I made a website, but I don't know if they ever visited it, as I never told them the address.</p><h2>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</h2><p>I consider myself a frequent website updater, not counting the times I didn't update it for 2 weeks due to lack of ideas, I usually update it once or twice in a week.</p><h2>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</h2><p>I don't change it often. I'm actually surprised that some webmasters will frequently redesign their home page, it sounds like a lot of work.</p><h2>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</h2><p>It's usually hobby-focused and me-focused.</p><h2>39. Do you do web design professionally?</h2><p>Not at all.</p><h2>40. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</h2><p>I'm a student studying engineering, and sometimes there are courses teaching programming. While website designing sounds cool, I'm not sure if I want it as a job.</p><h2>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</h2><p>Not really, but I'd love to!</p><h2>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</h2><p>I'm trying to reduce my social media time, or at least only use it when I really need to. While indie websites aren't a 100% replacement for social media, I do see the appeal.</p><h2>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</h2><p>I often use Discord and Whatsapp, since most of my friends use them.</p><h2>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</h2><p>You can check the Listening section if you want to know what song/video I've been listening to, but my favourite artists are The Crane Wives, Will Wood and Yaelokre. I also love the songs Past the Stargazing Season and Butcher Vanity.</p><h2>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</h2><p>I also have a Nekoweb website, but I eventually realised one website is suffice, unless if I make a NSFW website. I have considered making one, but then I realised I only explores that topic once a blue moon, and that website would be very dead for ages.</p><h2>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</h2><p>I mainly talk about OCs, art and random daily thoughts. It's somewhat diverse? I think?</p><h2>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</h2><p>What's different from Internet me and IRL me is that Internet me is a bit more talkative, especially on this website. IRL me is a bit awkward, really bad at starting conversations. Being on the Internet helps me express myself actually.</p><h2>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</h2><p>Well yea, mentioned in Q34.</p><h2>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</h2><p>Well yea, it's a bit buggy on Chrome sometimes, but it does its job.</p><h2>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</h2><p>Even if you love pastel colors, make sure the text and background have enough contrast. Also please don't blast loud music on your website unprompted :(</p><h2>51. What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?</h2><p>Making your website mobile-friendly, it takes a bit of creativity, but it is not exactly hard.</p><h2>52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</h2><p>I've switched to semantic HTML at a certain point, might not be perfect but it's better.</p><h2>53. Do you consider different browsers?</h2><p>I mainly use Firefox, I used to use Chrome for the Shimeji extension, but I don't need it anymore as I found a way to run it on Mac. I only open other browsers when there are some issues with some websites, or I wanted to see the effects on other browsers.</p><h2>54. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</h2><p>Firefox, you can change the tab colors.</p><h2>55. And what OS are you on?</h2><p>Mac, which is very annoying when looking for Steam games.</p><h2>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</h2><p>I would love to switch to other OS, but it's a pain.</p><h2>57. Are your websites mobile-friendly?</h2><p>Yuh</p><h2>58. What are your thoughts on autoplay?</h2><p>Please no</p><h2>59. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</h2><p>I joined a bit more than I needed at the beginning, but now I only join one when I really want to. I did find some cool websites from webrings, but I wish they are more interactive.</p><h2>60. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page?</h2><p>I made a few for my fav medias and characters, I mainly talk about how I found it and what I love about it. I like it when people talk about the fun facts of their fav media, I love trivia</p><h2>61. Are your websites "cliche", in your opinion?</h2><p>I'm not sure the definition of cliche in the context of indie websites, so I don't know if it's cliche, I only know it isn't exactly flashy.</p><h2>62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</h2><p>A website that is memorable, has cool mechanics! But that would be a lot of coding, and I'm not that smart.</p><h2>63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</h2><p>While I am an artist, I don't like drawing assets. I only like drawing characters, please don't make me draw borders and lines :(</p><h2>64.What are your favourite resource sites?</h2><p>For learning HTML, w3school and MDN are usually the first google results that show me the tips. For little icons, I search for SVG websites such as <a href="https://www.svgrepo.com/" target="_blank">SVG Repo</a>. There is also <a href="foollovers.com" target="_blank">FoolLovers</a> which provides cute assets, but I don't like going there as the only method of accessing it is through Wayback Machine (it blocked my region for some reason), and the image links are usually broken.</p><h2>65. Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</h2><p>Git commiting before realising I'm forgetting to update the update logs.</p><h2>66. What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</h2><p>If you don't understand HTML, you can first listen the very basics of it. Then, try a template and mess around by pressing f12 on any websites you find cool. By messing around the CSS and tags, you will eventually understand how it works. That's how I learnt HTML.</p><h2>67. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</h2><p>I usually do the styling in CSS, I only hard-code when only some specific elements require it.</p><h2>68. What do you think of frameset layouts?</h2><p>I remember being taught this in primary school, wow so it wasn't a dream.</p><h2>69. How about table-based layouts?</h2><p>I just feel like they would be a pain to turn them mobile friendly.</p><h2>70. Do you subscribe to the ideas of "one-column", "two-column" and "three-column" layouts? Do you use any of these?</h2><p>Vast majority of the websites I see are column based, and for my case it's three columns on the main page, two for my OC pages, and one for the rest. It is hard to imagine what other kinds of layouts there are, rows?</p><h2>71. Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS?</h2><p>Likely CSS, since this is how the layout comes together.</p><h2>72. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</h2><p><a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_blank">Motherfucking Website</a> core, but I don't think I'd make one.</p><h2>73. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</h2><p>I only make layouts when I actually need them, I make them based off what I want to write. Like the new song page layout, I actually have the idea of the song page first, then I make the layout theme CDs.</p><h2>74. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</h2><p>Chaotic advanced, I'm good at HTML but I might have skipped over some essentials.</p><h2>75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</h2><p>Sometimes. I like to open up the source code and see how the webmaster did something, and I also occasionally go into non-mobile-friendly sites, and edit it using DevTools to try to make it mobile-friendly.</p><h2>76. How did YOU learn how to make websites?</h2><p>By fucking around with DevTools</p><h2>77. Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</h2><p>I used to make &lt;a&gt; tags behave like buttons, and use divs instead of spans, aside from that, no I don't think so.</p><h2>78. Thoughts on floating elements?</h2><p>Not much opinion, it's handy sometimes.</p><h2>79. When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</h2><p>Usually % if I want it to size according to the window size.</p><h2>80. Do you have a favourite font?</h2><p>I don't have a huge preference to fonts, but since I've been using the Fraunces font, I guess it's my favourite now</p><h2>81. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</h2><p>I don't think I would, they should run their own website, and I should run my own. But if there is some strange circumstances where we had to share the same website, I would just open two directories for each of us.</p><h2>82. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</h2><p>I won't say a lot, but I sometimes check out some new websites from the Neocities global feed and webrings.</p><h2>83. Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</h2><p>I don't use the bookmark function a lot since I'm already following my fav websites using the follow function in Neocities.</p><h2>84. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</h2><p>Probably the OCs, they are not detailed, but at least I want to give of the impression that I'm a geek.</p><h2>85. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</h2><p>I like coding, but I don't have much interest otherwise.</p><h2>86. How often and for how long are you online?</h2><p>I started to be chronically online since grade 4, regardless how unhealthy it was for a child to get attached to the Internet, it was the place that welcomed me, which the outside world didn't.</p><h2>87. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</h2><p>Mainly myself, and maybe other OC enthusiasts.</p><h2>88. Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</h2><p>Looked it up and, no I don't think so.</p><h2>89. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?</h2><p>I regularly code some Javascript to handle fetching elements from somewhere to another, I also have 11ty to make blog pages.</p><h2>90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</h2><p>11ty really made my job easier. I remember hearing a phrase 'Humans tend to do things in the most convenient way' and I believe it really applies to me, cuz I don't think I would enjoy coding HTML as much if it weren't for these tools to do the repetitive and boring parts.</p><h2>91. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</h2><p>Has the fc2 counter on my main page, because I see others doing it as well. There might be a way to use Neocities view count instead, but Neocities one might not be as accurate (I think it counts repeated visits?).</p><h2>92. Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</h2><p>I made an account in the Melonland Forum, I sometimes post there when I see interesting topics.</p><h2>93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</h2><p>For most of my pages, I just write into my editor. But sometimes I might write my blogs on my phone when I don't have my laptop with me, then I will copy my stuff from my notes.</p><h2>94. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?</h2><p>There is one time a teacher told me I look like a jockey and showed me some pics of female jockeys, I don't think I look cool, but I enjoyed that compliment<s>, I like cool women as well :33</s>.</p><h2>95. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</h2><p>There are some circumstances that I found some art so bad looking I would just remove it from the page, but it doesn't happen often.</p><h2>96. Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?</h2><p>As someone who threw away my old art and regretted it badly, I would always leave an archive.</p><h2>97. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</h2><p>I overshare I think, I hope a detective won't dox me.</p><h2>98. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</h2><p>I don't have a specific online best friend, but if I have to pick the ones with a website, you can check out <a href="https://puddingpudd.com/" target="_blank">Pudding</a> and <a href="https://pianobonds.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Pianobonds</a> (There's one more but idk he wants me to show).</p><h2>99. And do you optimise the images on your website?</h2><p>I always resize and compress my images before uploading to Dropbox, I think I should try converting them to webps in the future.</p><h2>100. We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100</h2><p>I had to finish this blog in the next day, I also had a stomachache last night, so I am incredibly sleepy right now.</p><p class="date">( 24 Nov 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
