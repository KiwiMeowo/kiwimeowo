As of writing it's 9a.m., around 15 hours left until 2026 arrives. So just like last year, I'm going to review the stuff I did the past year.</p><hr><h2>Blogs</h2><p>So, to summarise the amount of blogs I wrote:</p><ul><li>Jan-Mar: 32</li><li>Apr-Jun: 25</li><li>Jul-Sep: 21</li><li>Oct-Dec: 32 + 1 = 33</li></ul><h3 style="text-align:center">Total blogs written: 111</h3><p>It's was only 4 blogs short compared to last year, which is somewhat shocking considering my low energy period during Jul-Sep. I wonder how much I could've written if I didn't get depressed that time, but no point in imagining, let's move on to the word count.</p><ul><li>Jan-Mar: 21663 (~677 words per blog)</li><li>Apr-Jun: 20410 (~816 words per blog)</li><li>Jul-Sep: 17190 (~818 words per blog)</li><li>Oct-Dec: 25254 + 1544 = 26798 (~812 words per blog)</li></ul><h3 style="text-align:center">Total word count: 86061 (~775 words per blog)</h3><p>I lowkey downloaded a word count package for 11ty just to get the total word count of the blogs easier. Anyways, despite Jul-Sep having the least amount of blogs, it has the highest word count per blog, interesting.</p><p>Now here's an interesting topic which I didn't do last year:</p><h3>Blog with the highest word count: <a href="11-24.html">Webmaster Questionnaire (24 Nov 2025)</a></h3><p>Well, it isn't exactly fair, is it? Considering the questionaire has 100 questions included, it increases the word count significantly, so of course it has <mark>3551 words</mark>. So why to review the top 3 highest word count blogs?</p><h3>2. Cookie Run: How it influenced me</h3><p>A blog with <mark>2419 words</mark>, it's about my experience with Cookie Run. It has been 7 years since I started playing Cookie Run (if I count CROB and CRK as the same thing), despites all the flaws (like being p2w and probably doesn't listen to feedback unless the fans bring out a truch), I really love the stories and characters.</p><h3>3. CRK: Eternal Sugar and Hollyberry (8 May 2025)</h3><p>Cookie run again, and <mark>2259 words</mark>! Hollyberry is my favourite Ancient, so her story arc with her Beast counterpart, Eternal Sugar, was one of the stories I looked forward to the most. And I think among the five Beasts stories, I enjoy this one the most.</p><p>And there's one more award for my blog of the year, drum roll please?</p><h3 style="text-align:center"><mark>Project: Eden's Garden (6 Jan 2025)</mark></h3><p>I think about this blog sometimes, Eden's Garden managed to make me feel a connection to a character so strong, it kinda healed some part of me. Eva Tsunaka's distrust towards others is extremely relatable, having being mistreated, you are bound to see everyone as a potential enemy. Even when they treat you "kindly", you just know they don't actually like you. It hitted my so close to home, that I feel kinda shy seeing anything Eden's Garden related, like damn? Eva my beloved...</p><hr><h2>Website</h2><p>Because I started to use VSCode and got the Git Deploy Neocities thing, I got to edit the files for more easily, allowing me to code more fancy stuff.</p><h3>RSS Feed</h3><p>One of the best things I've added to my site is an RSS feed, allowing those with a RSS reader to follow my site. In case you don't know, RSS feed is like a notification list, if you put the link to your RSS reader, the RSS reader will notify you everytime the feed updates.</p><p>While those in Neocities can follow me to check out updates, those who aren't using Neocities will have a harder time and needs to visit my site manually to see if anything new is added. By using RSS feeds, they can see when I post art or blog posts. I've talked about implementing the RSS feeds in the <a href="12-27.html">blog of 27 Dec 2025</a>, it took me a while to figure things out, but yea I did it.</p><h3>OC relationship dialog</h3><p>Chart, diagram, box, whatever they're called. You see those boxes which contain an OC's relationship to other OC? It used to be a collapsible that shows what the character has to say for the other when it's clicked. However, I found it a bit not very pretty, a bit crammed also. So I decided to change it into flip card format, which is far cuter.</p><h3>Dress up room</h3><p>I talked about it in <a href="11-28.html">28 Nov 2025</a>, I have a dress up game, I have a achievement room, UH! Achievement dress up game room (old ass meme reference). There's a lot of clothings I have yet to add, but I'm proud of it nevertheless.</p><h3>Time theme toggler</h3><p>I added it yesterday, it's a theme toggler, but it changes depending on what time it is now for me. If it's morning (after 6a.m. and before 10a.m.), it's morning colored, cool and dim. If it's afternoon (after 10 a.m. and before 6p.m.), it will be my default colors. If it's night (after 7p.m. and before 6a.m.), it will be dark and some images will be found glowing. If it's 6p.m. however, it will be sunset, a beautiful orange envelopes the page.</p><p>I've always thought of adding a theme toggler, but I didn't have much motivation to do it, it just felt not very special. And also I use different themes depending on the page, so a theme toggler just makes it more complicated. But theme changing depending on the time? Now that's cool. This feature will only be available on the index page for now, not sure if I will put it anywhere else though.</p><p>By the way, if you find some of the header images familiar, they are taken from Sky: COTL.</p><p>There's a lot of things I've added this year, so here's some honourable mentions:</p><ul><li>Added fancy deco in OC index</li><li>Full blog map</li><li>Added the blog page tags at the bottom of the blog link box</li><li>Made my about page filled with trinkets</li><li>Song page redesigns</li><li>Drawbox added</li><li>Added Cookie Run, Sky: COTL and Minecraft Shrines</li></ul><hr><h2>OCs</h2><p>It felt like my memory's gotten blurry, I couldn't remember much I did with the OC lore. I got to write down the stories of Jaspers, RS gang and the main gang in the writings section, but I feel like I should rewrite some of them as I feel they don't convey what I wanted to do. There are other OC writings I've done, but they are all major spoiler territory...</p><p>As for OC refs, I've added two, which is Wolf and Kaylee. While I have planned Wolf's design for a while, Kaylee's ref is very sudden, like in the middle of ArtFight. Her concept was there, but I didn't expect to draw her just because I got bored from drawing ArtFight. But welcome to the finalised design family, Raven and Bun can wait a bit longer lol.</p><hr><h2>Art</h2><p>You can check out the <a href="/art/summary/2025.html">2025 Art Summary</a>, but to put it short, I feel like I've gotten a better hand on alchohol markers. I also feel like I have improved in coloring, in 2024 my coloring method was kinda all over the place, as if I haven't settled in how I want to color stuff. In 2025, the colors are cleaner, I still love the Mira and Lavender drawing so much. As for anatomy, I think the head is less distorted in 2025, artists remember to flip your canvas regularly!</p><hr><h2>Life</h2><h3>Internship</h3><p>One of the most major things in my life has to be the internship, I've met new friends, seen new places, and got to work in a office. How did I feel? Kinda depressed to be honestly, the office is quiet and boring, and I was so bad at speaking correctly I felt like I'm always five steps behind my peers. It is a nice experiience though.</p><h3>New media I've tried</h3><ul><li>It takes two (The damn book is annoying but the art and gameplay is very good)</li><li>Potion Craft (Quite fun and challenging)</li><li>Project: Eden's Garden (I'm crying)</li><li>Mindhack (Pretty good)</li><li>Horse Race Tests (It's more of a community thing, but uh yea it's funny)</li><li>Umamusume (Why am I obsessed with horses now)</li><li>The entire FLAVOR FOLEY song list (Banger after bangers)</li></ul><p>While to some people, trying out new media isn't a big deal, like I've mentioned a couple times in the past, I'm weirdly sensitive about topics related to my trauma, even the smallest reminders can send my mental state down a sprial. The fact I tried out so many things this year really shows I should give myself a pat on the back.</p><h3>Kayaking</h3><p>Not much to mention, but kayaking is fun. You should do it if you got the chance, remember to bring waterproof bags and sunscreen though.</p><h3>Meeting up with my friend</h3><p>After that time I went to get lunch with the friend I haven't met in 8 years, we continued to hang out. We went to musuems, cat café, restaurants, or just walking on the street. I'm not sure why he wants to hang out with me (considering 90% of the people thinks I'm weird), but I had fun being around him.</p><hr><p>And that might be all I need to mention at the moment. I will spend the rest of the day chilling, I think. I didn't sleep well yesterday because I got hit by a pretty great news, and I had to code stuff to process my emotions.</p><p class="date">( 31 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
