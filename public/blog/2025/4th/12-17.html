I didn't watch the trailer (They tend to spoil everything, I'll just enjoy the plot when the update is actually here), so I didn't know what would actually be told. Knowing Millennial Tree, I didn't expect him to do anything meaningful, he is basically the Potential Man of the Cookie Run franchise.</p><hr><h2>History of the Tree</h2><p>A little background on Millennial Tree Cookie, he is a legendary cookie released on October 8, 2018, in the same update Pome was released. However, his first appearance is in the background of Land 8 Trophy Race, where he is shown in the tree form:</p><img src="/assets/Land8_bg.webp" alt="Land 8 background"><p>When he was released, he was no longer seen in the background, appearing to the game as a playable character instead. Being a new player, I was ecstatic about him, he is a god who controls nature and even time. He might even defeat Dark Enchantress Cookie, the most powerful villain at the time, what could he not do?</p><p>Fun fact: He is designed by <a href="https://x.com/_SLEEPING_EARTH" target="_blank">SLEEPING_EARTH</a>, and the artist has drawn him multiple times.</p><img src="https://dcimg1.dcinside.com/viewimage.php?id=2eb2df2decd72ab360&no=24b0d769e1d32ca73fec80fa11d028319511fc2d4825bdd78ebab3202e4a05549d579acd467bc53752de1786314cb025dd2d74fc62489b79b5b6bbdc7eef6c17e28ab3b542" alt="Millennial Tree Cookie"><center><a href="https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=cookierun&no=451821" target="_blank">Dcard post</a></center><img src="https://dcimg1.dcinside.com/viewimage.php?id=2eb2df2decd72ab360b0c0b018&no=24b0d769e1d32ca73fee87fa11d02831c3cad598d6c02bb0ff75d5f6ac252f5e19b96c33e2ef0ce8f771eb92c3904430ab94be5f3270c9c4ba76f895a6ade86759eafdca33b4a6028d402df1bf1b4de46d871f454c2c52edc09226cfb72a3808ecb15ed48b7dafd278d84063e4&orgExt" alt="Christmas Millennial Tree"><center><a href="https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=cookierunoven&no=4256" target="_blank">Dcard post</a></center><hr><h2>Potential Man</h2><p>But over the years, he didn't do much, or even do anything significant at all. In the Hidden Truth of the City update, Churro has to fight corrupted Wind Archer while MT is uh, somewhere else, and the story uses the same damn cutscene image over and over again (According to some concept art, that story would've been a lot more exciting).</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o9dh9ibldgo1fpn9ugw2o/The_hidden_truth_of_the_city_concept_art_2025-Dec-17.webp?rlkey=xdciwtry4918x16ec3o536kap&raw=1" alt="Hidden Truth of the City"><center>Damn they robbed us from more Pome screentime</center><p>And in Curse of the Sacred Forest, good lord... It's possibly the worst story, featuring:</p><ul><li>Purple Yam Cookie, who's mad at everything (Like he always do, but still)</li><li>Rambutan "I miss Lychee Dragon Cookie, I miss them a lot" Cookie</li><li>Blue Lily Cookie, who complains about others every five seconds</li><li>Millennial Jade Deer, who will kill you if you look at it wrong (both story and gameplay wise)</li><li>Arguing, arguing, and even more arguing</li><li>It's ok if Blue Lily is rude, because she cried at the end, right?</li><li>And the worst of all: Millennial lazy ass Tree, appears at the end, refuses to elaborate, leaves (He gave them a leaf).</li></ul><p>That update is actually hated by plenty of people, Pomegranate being there didn't justify how awful that story was (NGL Pome being nice to Shroomy feels a bit OOC when she was cold to almost everyone, but who knows, Pome wasn't fully characterized yet), and Blue Lily was hated as hell, including me. However, I don't think she deserved to be hated that much when Millennial Tree was there, like seriously you're a god, do something about the dragons???</p><p>Over the years of lore development, a lot of disasters had happened: Longan Dragon trying to kill all cookies, Sugar Swan getting corrupted, Wind Archer getting corrupted... And yet he either did very little, or none at all. When I found out that many people also made fun of Millennial Tree's inaction, I was quite happy. Potential Man, 0 feats, 0 personality, 7 years wasted doing nothing.</p><hr><h2>Headcanon time</h2><p>I had a headcanon/theory that the reason Millennial Tree didn't do anything too significant about disasters is because he doesn't want to risk causing another disaster to happen.</p><p>As a god of nature and time, his roots can sense the events from the past and future, and catastrophes which may kill thousands. And yet, he doesn't do anything, but not because he wasn't capable of changing it, nor because he's lazy (lol), but because it wasn't worth the risk of whatever that might happen. Altering timelines is an extremely risky thing, you know the meme which a time traveller moves a chair, then a major change happens? Imagine changing an event as significant as a historic event, what and how much would change? And what if the changed event is worse than the thing you are trying to prevent, going from thousands being killed to millions being killed?</p><p>Millennial Tree, having lived a long time and possibly seen a thousand of possibilities ahead of us, might have accumulated knowledge on what should and shouldn't be intervened. And perhaps, he sees a future worse than the current one if he does too much. Even though what's going to happen will be bad, and inaction might make him look bad, he will not stop the tragedy as it is a part of this world.</p><p>But honestly, Cookie Run stories are hit or miss, and I didn't expect MT having actual reason behind his actions, so yea forget about what I said.</p><hr><p>Ok rambling done, let's get back to:</p><h2>Update</h2><p>While the trailer showed the Ancients, I'm still surprised the update story to include them, I thought this update is about the legendaries? The story starts will Millennial Tree gathering the other Guardians of Nature <s>and SeaMoon yuri</s>, then they went over the Ancients' kingdoms to bless them. We also got to see the Ancients returning to their kingdoms in their awakened form and new mindset. We got to see several cookies that we haven't seen in a long time (Cream Puff, Tea Knight etc), it really feels like the beginning of the end, the final battle is coming huh.</p><p>The Ancients then gathered together in Pure Vanilla's Castle, discussing the battle against Dark Enchantress. Everyone, except White Lily, was there, White Lily might have considered to fight alone from what's shown in the Silent Salt update. While the Ancients were waiting, Golden Cheese decided to get some fresh air outside, but started to cry, remembering what Dark Enchantress, or White Lily, did to her kingdom.</p><p>I really like how Cookie Run handled her relationship with White Lily. While in the story, Golden Cheese understands White Lily did not have control over Dark Enchantress, but that betrayal and grief cannot be eased by simply knowing this fact. Some people worried that Golden Cheese would forgive White Lily too quickly, and the writers isn't known to write a consistent quality of stories. So I'm thankful it is shown what Golden Cheese feels about White Lily<s>, maybe GC is CRK's favourite Ancient IDK</s>.</p><p>The Ancients then went to the Faerie Kingdom to look for White Lily Cookie. They then found Sugarfly Cookie, who's trying to find the faeries after leaving Eternal Sugar's paradise. Apparently, all the cookies in the Faerie Kingdom are missing, which is confusing. She also mentioned she wanted to meet Elder Faerie Cookie... But uh, does she know? (He died)</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rye2vbbc6gkvulviw26jy/comic_2025-Dec-17.webp?rlkey=f30wlt3a66kwnc5w9ifibyijl&raw=1" alt="Sugarfly and the Faeries"><center>Someone made a funny comic about Sugar Faerie reuniting with the faeries during the Eternal Sugar update. I couldn't find the comic, so I recreated it using <a href="https://cookierun.comic.studio/?lang=en" target="_blank">Cookie Run Comic Studio</a>.</center><p>Millennial Tree and Wind Archer suddenly appeared in front of the gang, explaining the plans of Dark Enchantress. Gingerbrave asks Millennial Tree to join the battle, but he refuses, classic MT... However, there IS an actual reason behind that, and the following story shocked me...</p><h2>Wait huh?</h2><p>For the longest time, many fans assumed Sugar Swan and Millennial Tree were responsible for creating Wind Archer or giving him power, and I also developed a headcanon of a father-son like relationship between them, Millennial Tree being the father and vise versa. And in the CRK story, it's possible that Wind Archer is older than Millennial Tree, as MT was a sprout/young cookie when he first met Wind Archer. The fact we got to see Millennial Tree as a child is actually mind-blowing????</p><p>Being a young kid, Millennial Tree (or just Tree Cookie since he's young) likeed to venture around. However, when he returned to his forest, he realised the importance of his role as a omni-potent child-god when he saw the dead forest after being left alone. So that scene established that he has to stay in that forest to protect it from dying, and that's why he can't do a lot in stories.</p><p>Instead of physically travelling in Earthbread, he decided to spread his roots like a tree, extending his roots into every corner on the land. He gave Wind Archer a cookie form, and gathered the other legendaries, giving them the role as the Guardians of Nature.</p><p>But despite that, he did something: Destorying the barrier Dark Enchantress made, helping the gang to start the battle against her. That may be the most Millennial Tree did the past 7 years.</p><hr><p>Anyways, the lore reveal of MT broke the minds of many people:</p><blockquote><p>Imagine being a twink forever as you watch your son grow into a dilf</p><p style="text-align:right">@L0velessL0ver</p></blockquote><p>While MT might need more time to beat the Potential Man allegations, it is nice to learn more about the worldbuilding of CRK.</p><p class="date">( 17 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
