Like "I've sent you a message in game" or "When can you book a badminton session". And then it turns out that the person sent the message to the wrong user, then they turn this accident into an opportunity to meet a new friend. They then asks you for your interests, your live, etc etc.</p><p>Sad news is that those are most likely not new friends, but scams. They pretend to be friend first, then once you developed trust, they will ask for something, like money, your intimate photos, or to use some app or game. And at the end, you will be taken advantage of, often losing money.</p><p>I've received these messages multiple times, there's one thinking I'm a badminton coach, one thinking I'm an electrician, one thinking I opened a dance lesson, and some thinking I ordered stuff (well that one said sorry and left when they realised they got the wrong person so I think they are a genuine person). After they realise they are wrong, instead of moving on, they kept asking about my personal life, or even asking "thoughtful" questions like "Have you eaten yet", some even invite me to eat with them. Like man you barely know me, don't pretend I can trust you ew. While I don't mind having a random friend on the Internet, the kindness feels too uncanny valley to be trusted, and I've watched too much 東張西望 (A program at dinner time, showing celebrity stuff and misfortunes people encountered, like scams or being harmed). I occassionally talk to them for a while cuz I'm bored, but eventually I feel so unnerved by the person I just block them.</p><p>I normally see these messages on Whatsapp, but recently I got one on Discord. Yesterday, someone came into my DMs and said they messaged me in Tales Dragons: New Journey (don't play it, it's shady af). I said I don't play that game, and they said they got the wrong person... Yea I know where this is going. They then called me their new friend (they sent me a friend request but I actually didn't accept it LOL), and asked me some generic questions like I said above. They finally said their important question: Download a totally not sus game called Tales Dragons: New Journey (seriously don't play it). I looked it up, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Maleficent/comments/15v56qv/just_stumbled_upon_the_tales_dragons_new_journey/" target="_blank">and look how good its reputation is</a> /sarcasm!</p><p>And apparently, these scammers are hired to promote the game and get people to spend money on this generic gacha idle game, with a dragon and skinny anime girls nonetheless. Seriously, dragons are so overused, come up with something new already.</p><blockquote><p>“Nora” from Ireland “recruited” me to play the game, and eventually connected me with a guid leader. I was foolish enough to spend a few bucks on this game.</p><p>After a while, the guild leader for the server I was in (Discord user soul88888888 , ID 1019583672241885204) then claimed Nora had cancer and Nora’s discord account was promptly deleted right after. I mean yeah I’m stupid but lmfao do you think I’d fall for that.</p><p>Also, yeah they tried to get me to spend like $300 on this game, and the devs are in on it. The guild leader accidentally said “You can contact us on customer support” (they later edited it but well ygm), so these guys are literally the game devs trying to make a few bucks by preying on ppl being lonely and posing as girls who want friends in a game.</p><p>TLDR : THIS IS A SCAM, RUN</p><p style="text-align:right">By Phytor_c</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Hey peps, so after talking to one of the “scammers” they are apparently from China, and there is a company that hires interns and asks them to promote the game/games,</p><p>since the job market there is quite bad people are desperate, “world market is shit btw not just them”</p><p style="text-align:right">By InternationalNature7</p></blockquote><p>After looking this up, I told that person "To prove you are not a scam: Tell you what you think about Cookie Run". After that, the person didn't reply at all. That might be a mistake on my part, I really wanted to annoy someone by infodumping about Cookie Run lore. I wanted to wait for next day to see if they would reply me, but they unfortunately, blocked me :(</p><p>It's a shame I can't spam this person with the main story of CRK as a dayoff activity (I had an exam yesterday), oh well, if any of you wants to be spammed with CRK lore, just tell me (joking, unless?)</p><p class="date">( 10 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
