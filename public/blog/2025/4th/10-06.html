Luckily, they cleaned and fixed my glasses for free, now it's back like new! Anyways, I started to think about my history with glasses.</p><p>Among all the cousins, I was the last one to get a pair of glasses. When all my relatives joked about how I am the only one without glasses, I felt a bit stressed if I break that record. But the truth was that I was already near-sighted, I mean how can an Ipad kid not get near-sighted? I didn't ask for glasses for a long time, so I struggled to look at the blackboard, or worse, when they use the projector.</p><p>It's only during secondary school that I got my glasses. I asked for black glasses frame since I was afraid that I would get in trouble for having too colorful glasses, but I don't think the handbook says anything about glasses lol. I remember the first day I took my glasses to school, before I said anything, my classmates were like "wow you look fine in your glasses ^^" in a comforting tone... I didn't even say I was insecure, you only made me feel like I look awful :(</p><p>Honestly, I feel like I look way better with glasses. I always feel insecure about my appearance, and having glasses makes me look a bit less childish? I won't say it is worth blinding myself though.</p><p>At multiple times of my life, I have broken the hinge in different glasses. I probably accidentally sat on them, and since the hinges were plastic, they easily broke. But glasses frames are expensive, I didn't want to replace them, so I simply taped them up. If I tape them well, nobody would notice the glasses were even broken. But if I use tape that is different colored, people would start reminding me to replace my glasses. But seriously, why spend money when I can use do a mini fix?</p><p>When I went to university, I finally got a pair of glasses that isn't black. It is thin, made of metal, and got a little glitter on the side, very pretty. Up until now, this pair of glasses is still in use.</p><hr><p>I really should remember taking breaks from my phone regularly, I shouldn't wreck my eyesight even further.</p><p class="date">( 6 Oct 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
