Sock folding is so tedious, why isn't there an invention which folds them quickly?</p><p>Doing laundry isn't so bad most of the time, you divide the dirty clothing into light and dark colors (It isn't necessary if your clothes aren't new, but my family's one week worth of clothing can fit in one washing machine anyways), put the laundry powder in the slot, let it run, put away your dried clothing at the window (Yes I just let the dried clothing there for an entire week), then put the washed clothing at the window.</p><p>The part I found the most tedious is the socks. For clothings like shirt and pants, you can just put it on a hanger when drying, then just fold them into squares when you put them away. For hoodies and dresses, I just put them in the closet while still hanging on a hanger, which is easier. But for socks, the steps goes like this:</p><ol><li>Get one sock</li><ul><li>If it's inside out, turn it back the correct way</li></ul><li>Find the other sock</li><ul><li>(If can't find it yet, grab another sock and find it's pair)</li></ul><li>After finding one, hang the pair together</li><li>After drying, fold it.</li></ol><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/87/1c/16/871c16c9053afe973d2263b88a5dd7f1.jpg" alt="Sock folding"><center>My method of sock folding</center><p>The fact I have to find the pairs makes it way more time-consuming than shirts and pants. What's worse is that there are more pairs of socks than there are shirts and pants combined! I change my outdoor clothing every two days, but I change socks every day, that makes drying socks more annoying. One thing more annoying is most of the socks are white, but the patterns and length are slightly different, so that makes the sorting process a lot harder.</p><p>There is a thing called a shirt folding board, it makes shirt folding a lot easier when there is a guide, but I don't find that too necessary. One thing I wish that exist is a sock folding device, which would save a lot of time, and as far as I'm aware, it doesn't exist (There is a product named SockSync which helps sock matching, but it doesn't really help matching socks that are all white but slightly different).</p><p>Well I should go back to my laundry now, perhaps I should just fold the sock in half instead of the inside-out method.</p><p class="date">( 5 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
