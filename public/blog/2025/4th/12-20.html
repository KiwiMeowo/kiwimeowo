Thank you me, for stepping out of my comfort zone.</p><p>Anyways, all the songs by the band and JamieP are so amazing, but to keep the theme of the blog consistent, I will talk about the Flavor Foley album CARDIAC CONTREPOINT.</p><hr><h2>Butcher Vanity</h2><p>I actually have talked about this song before, in the blog of <a href="../1st/03-07.html">7 March</a>, it was the first song I've listened from this band. While I'm not into the idea of cannibalism as a form of love, it is incredibly catchy. I really how the Chinese lyrics blends into English. Also, Yi Xi is hot, <s>I'm almost convinced to let her eat me</s>.</p><h2>Rawdog (Mature content mentioned?)</h2><p><span class="spoiler">So when I checked this song out, I was expecting it to be just dog themed, and the word "rawdog" was referring to doing tasks the raw way or whatever, just a slang. And to my surprise, this song is about sex.</span></p><p><span class="spoiler">While I hate seeing sex in movies and shows, I don't mind listening it in song format. And yea, it slaps, which can be annoying since I feel weird listening it without headphones lol.</span></p><h2>Weathergirl</h2><p>The theme of this song is weather, the MV is rainy, windy, and cloudy. I'm not sure what the style of the song would be before I clicked the video, but I was surprised how the voicebank, Eleanor Forte, sounds very beautiful. Her voice matches the instrumentals very well, just like listening to sounds of bad weather.</p><p>This song feels sorrowful, like griefing how you have drifted apart with someone important to you, and you couldn't reconnect with them anymore. Perhaps I have a soft spot for sorrowful songs, this might be my new favourite song from CARDIAC CONTREPOINT.</p><h2>炜WARD ROMANCE</h2><p>This song also has elements of Chinese, <s>no it's fine, I just didn't expect it to be Chinese is all</s>. This song is about having romanic love and raves, it's such a banger. When the crowds noises came up, I wondered if they are made by voicebanks as well... And yes they are, 35 of them in fact. I love how in the description, JamieP went on a rant about having to mix 35 of them.</p><p>Water the Roses</p><p>This song uses Gumi for the vocals, a voicebank which I found nostalgic. Back in when I was slamming all the popular Vocaloid songs into my head, if I had to pick voicebanks I like the most, Gumi is probably one of my favs, her voice isn't too light, not too deep, right for my taste.</p><p>Anyways, this song is about moving on from a wilting love, a divorce song as what they say. While the lyrics say she will move on, what's show on MV is very heartbreaking. Especially when there's a part where every first character of the flower spells out "I still love you" really emphasizes how feelings linger if after the relationship has ended.</p><h2>Queen of Venus</h2><p>This song uses the voicebank Adachi Rei, which is made with sine waves in Audacity as opposed to human voices, which is very cool. This song fully embraces the artifical feeling of her voice, as this song is themed after a robot who loves a human. This song scared me at first, it does feel like a robot talking, but the lyrics are quite pretty as the robot loves the human like worshipping a god.</p><hr><p>Damn I have multiple songs to fixate over at the same time? Man it sucks my brain can only handle one song at a time.</p><p class="date">( 20 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
