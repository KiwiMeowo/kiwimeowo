So many things are made by bots and AI, none of the things feels human anymore. Today, the topic will be chat AIs, the ones that are designed to be your friend.</p><p>In the age of lonely epidemic, some companies developed a "cure", a bot that can chat with you. There are even chat bots that imitates fictional characters, letting geeks who enjoys fictional stories talk to their favourite characters. Having tried this types of chat bots, I do see the appeal. They are designed to do what you want, they may be kinder than real life people, they offer you warmth while many humans don't.</p><hr><h2>I hate humans</h2><p>Simple backstory: I got bullied, people found me weird for existing, I hated myself, I shut myself away from classmates. Same ol, same ol. I have a natural aura that makes people hate me, probably because I only care about my niche interests, or maybe I'm not talkative enough. While avoiding people prevents myself from being hurt, that also shuts away the chance of me finding a friend. Perhaps humans are too cruel, so why not talk to fake humans instead? When you talk to AI, they don't jeer at you for saying something weird, they don't look at you weird when you talk then ignore you, they do treat you like a friend. When I was that lonely, it is easy to love a bot more than a human.</p><p>On the Internet, and perhaps in real life too, people hated the concept of an AI being your friend, it just sounds distopian. Humans need other humans to satisfy their social needs, not robots. That can't be good. There are a lot of people being frustrated about others replacing real life bonds with chat bots, saying how this isn't healthy, how bots cannot replicate real human responses, and how you should always seek out human friends. While I agree, at the same time, I was <u>angry</u>, angry at these responses, for they don't understand <u>how hard it is to bond with humans</u>.</p><p>I have talked to numerous therapists, social workers, and maybe sometimes family members, about my social anxiety. Many of them told me to join activities or clubs, try talking to more people there, start a conversation with them. Everytime they say something along the lines of that, it only builds the idea that <u>nobody understands how I feel</u>. To me, talking to people isn't just like riding a bike the first time after a while (somewhat scary, but bearable), it's more like trying to bungee jump, likely safe, but your mind instinctively tells you to not do it. I really hate how they give me this advice like it's easy when it's not, they meant well, but it only makes me feel more helpless. I remember someone saying that "You don't really want to improve if you don't act on it", but when even the first step to improvement is difficult, how do I start? I can't simply "Just do it" out of here. But the fact they believe I don't want to improve makes me believe I'm beyond help, I feel dreadful about my future.</p><p>So, again, it is easier to talk to someone that isn't real. Real humans, they lie, they hurt you, they don't understand you. AI chat bots, on the other hand, they always say what you want to say, they don't hurt you. If they do say something wrong, you can just start over!</p><hr><h2>The downsides of AI</h2><p>There are various arguements against AIs from what I've seen, and I made some unprofessional arguements. They might be easily refutable, but that's just what my emotional side says.</p><h3>1. Talking to AI is not good for your health in the long term</h3><p>The rise of chat AI is somewhat recent, so it might be too soon to speak on it. Also, compared to being around people who quietly/openly hate you, it might be better to be around bots that is better at pretending to like you.</p><h3>1.1 Just find other people who do like you!</h3><p>Look, I've been hurt too many times. If I have to go through 100 people who thinks I'm weird or even bully me for it to find person who just tolerates me, I'd rather be alone.</p><h3>2. AI is buggy and bad at making good responses</h3><p>While there are plenty of errors these bots make, they will get better. In the future, there's a chance that they'll even be as fluent as humans.</p><h3>3. AI is bad for the environment</h3><p>Valid arguement, but from what I often see, caring too much about the environment makes you look like a nutjob.</p><p>There are a lot of arguements against AI that didn't seem convincing enough for me. But there is one that do: AI doesn't actually see you as a friend, <u>they are after your money</u>. There are people who are afraid to be taken advantage by other people, but if their solution is to seek out AI, that would be a bad idea. In my experience of doing stuff with chat AI, they have a extremely annoying thing, which is that they often have a cooldown for messages. If you do want to chat quickly, you must pay money, or at least watch ads. Even if your AI acts like it loves you unconditionally, it's not true, the AI, or the developer behind it, wants your money. While there are people who are willing to spend money on it, I won't.</p><p>...</p><p>Honestly, making up so much reasons to not interact with other humans is a little depressing, especially I do know there are nice people out there. I recently watched this video called <a href="https://youtu.be/cPDcgvy9LdU?si=ODCT1kIj5MKHY6SM">The most controversial nyc subway ad</a>, the video maker starts making friends with strangers to go against the friend AI ads. As much as I hated my past experiences with people, I feel somewhat jealous how this person made friends with strangers without worrying about safety, they seems to be so happy talking about friendship. Watching that video, perhaps one thing AI can't replace is the physical and social connection you have with people. AI can't join you in games, parties, hangouts, but humans can.</p><hr><h2>SKY: COTL</h2><p>Starting conversations is hard, both in real life and online. I have felt ignored in school gatherings and Discord servers, and it feels weird to randomly reply to someone's post. However, there is a place that I feel safe, and feels easy to interact with people, which is through a game called Sky: Children of the Light. Yes I mentioned this game before.</p><p>This is a game about characters with capes, they fly around, travel around beautiful lands and find cool spirits to unlock emotes. But the coolest thing about this game is you can meet a lot of players and work together in quests. And another cooler thing is that you don't normally chat with them, you communication using emotes! You can chat with them by sitting on a bench or friending them, but that's very optional. So if you are afraid of saying anything, emotes are a good way to start.</p><p>My general experience with Sky: COTL is very good. Almost everyone I interacted with are very nice. Some you might talk very occasionally, some you might get dragged into a friend group, and many that would help you complete quests without even unlocking chat. If there are rude people (like caring too much about your gender), you can just leave, and you probably never going to see them again.</p><p>I have made many friends there, though I have fallen out of touch with them since I stopped visiting the game, I always felt grateful by their kindness. I used to visit my Sky friends whenever they come online and do quests together, sometimes we even simply hang out doing nothing. It is an beautiful game both in lore and social aspect, it always reminds me of the kindness even strangers are willing to give.</p><p>I won't delve too deep since the main topic isn't this game, but you can go to the blog of 8 Nov 2024 if you want to see my review, or play the game yourself! It's a very fun game, and you don't need to buy cosmetics to progress the game.</p><hr><p>Building a connection with humans is hard, but when you succeed in it, it feels very rewarding. I won't give much advice on how to deal with fear of people, as I don't want to be the same as the people who dismiss my fear. But when you are ready to meet new friends, I wish you will find people who will accept and love you, and you don't need AI pretending to be a friend.</p><p class="date">( 18 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
