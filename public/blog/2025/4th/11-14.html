As you can see, I am a stupidly sensitive person, how am I still alive? Anyways, I feel like I have been focusing too much on stuff I don't like, but how about media that I do like?</p><h2>Elimination games</h2><p>Among my major fixations, three of them (Danganronpa, Your Turn to Die, Blue Lock) fall under this category. I also enjoyed some parts of Squid Game, though I found the part where participants simply stab each other outside of game rounds boring. I also liked various real life shows where people play games and eliminate others for prizes, especially if they are very smart.</p><p>If we are talking about fictional ones, I enjoyed the characters dynamics a lot. The killing games often advertise their story has "drama and betrayal~" but I don't think this justifies how good their story can be. Divorce and romance stories also has drama and betrayal but I fucking hate them- Oh anyway, I love how the characters can bond even under worst circumstances, you can see the characters becoming friends then has a breakdown when their friend dies. Making friends there isn't a good idea, but bonding is a human experience, they can't help it. There is also a case where you sometimes can't trust your own friend as well, maybe they killed someone without you knowing, and trusting them might lead to someone or your death. Or maybe after you have a reconciliation with a friend, then they ask you for your trust right after they did something incredibly suspicious, man I love YTTD.</p><p>I also find it very exciting to watch if your favourite character survives. In a show like this, the odds of a character surviving is very low, especially the ones with a lot of screentime. I can watch my blorbo suddenly getting a death flag, then start to worry and get excited (because my blorbo won't be a forgettable character). Anyways, I feel like Chigiri won't last very long in Blue Lock and I'm worried :(</p><p>As for real life elimination shows, there have been a lot of real life Squid Game shows lately, and there are many other game shows that eliminates people one by one, still kinda like killing games. On the contrary to the statement above, I don't like it when real life killing games put too much drama into the show, I enjoy it more when they make it more lighthearted. In the Netflix real life Squid Game show, participants are often shown very upset and disturbed while playing this game, there's even a guy feeling sick for picking the worst choice for his team. Man I just want to see people have fun playing games.</p><p>So what I enjoy seeing in real life 'killing' games is people getting into strange shenanigans, finding interesting game mechanics/secrets, and seeing how they brilliantly solve or horribly fail the games. There's a show on Netflix which I forgot the name, where a group of intelligent people (doctors, celebrities, board game experts etc) gathered together to play games and earn prizes. I love seeing the people learn the rules of the game, finding secrets by trial and error, and get a secret advantage for finding the secret.</p><p>Like I mentioned, I like these kind of shows with a lighthearted plot. In the <a href="https://youtu.be/5oVKKD4ehcc?si=t-oPzE0kKrqd4prW" target="_blank">Hong Kong Season two<s>Squid</s> Cuttlefish Game show</a> (a show featuring Hong Kong celebrities from various generations), the overall tone is humourous. 陸永 in particular is especially funny, despite winning by doing nothing, he enhances the show by adding jokes. My favourite scene is in the 1:08:38 timemark, where 陸永 continuously yaps about 洪天明's King of Games title while 洪天明 was trying to concentrate (Fun fact: The reason a sushi, Flower of Love nigiri, appears on the subtitle is that 洪天明 won 20 thousand Flower of Love nigiri in a game show. When the store for the nigiri closes down, people joked that he ate so much of the sushi the store closed down).</p><p>But what I enjoy about both kinds of shows is the amount of creativity put into the games. Danganronpa designs flashy executions that kills the person brutally, Squid Game puts participants in games based off our childhood games, Blue Lock trains players in non-traditional forms of football (at least in the older arcs). These require a lot of creativity to make them entertaining, and I really enjoy that.</p><h2>The underdogs</h2><p>You know there's the types of media where it's just people making fun of them? So apparently, I enjoy watching people making fun of them, then perhaps get a guilty pleasure of said media. So uh, have you heard of Girls Know How to Fight by MCJams? No I'm not looking it up, I might shrivel up and die.</p><p>So there was a Youtuber who made fun of that music video, being young and a cringe hater, I watched his videos. But for some reason, I developed a strange fixation in the music video and this series, and even somehow finding an irl friend that enjoyed these videos as wel?? I remember feeling excited about the next part of the series, and worrying I would die randomly before it got released. I remember also submitting my Kyrea skin to one of the MCJams video, and actually got featured!!?? But she looked bald in the video since the top layer was missing. If you find that video, maybe you can share the screenshot of Kyrea lmao.</p><p>Another thing I enjoyed "hate-watching" was High Guardian Spice. From what I know, Crunchyroll, which is an anime streaming service, somehow starts an original series, which isn't an anime. Also, the series was made by women who said to focus on diversity but never said anything about the show itself, which you know already that is what the Internet likes to make fun of. When the show launched, people also found out how poorly made the show was, both in animation and story. As a result, there were plenty of rants, and also plenty of rewrites attempts.</p><p>While I have never watched the show itself, I really like watching the reactions and rewrites. I like listening how people either analyse how the show was bad, or just bashes on the show for being "SJW", both types of comments are entertaining. What I enjoy the most is listening is rewrites and new interpretations, there were funny abridged versions and serious story rehaulling.</p><p>There was one rewrite I found particularly memorable, <a href="https://youtu.be/DXObYENi3VM?si=T49xMU5fW30nnq22" target="_blank">which I believe is this video</a>. while most parts I found it a bit boring (sorry), I found the twist to be very cool. In the video, the protagonist Rosemary inherited her mother's sword, and her sword can return to the owner's hands by calling out a spell. So for the twist, in the scene where the main gang was fighting the big villain, in the critical moment where the villain looked like they're about to be defeated, the villain calmly said a phrase: The spell Rosemary uses to call back her sword. Then Rosemary's sword flew to the villain's hand, suddenly the villain side gained back their advantage in the fight. The moment managed to establish that the villain is Rosemary's mother without saying "Rosemary, I am your mother" or showing the villain's face, it also breaks the idea that the sword calling phrase is the symbol of the hero; The phrase that the audience always assumed was a spell of hope, suddenly turned into a spell of catastophe! Not to be a frog under the well <a href="#1" id="1b"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, but the twist was one of the coolest thing I've heard, it stuck in my head for a long time. I can't imagine how awesome the reaction would feel, the shock, the confusion trying to process what happened, then the dawning realization... I hope one day I can use this inspiration into my stories.</p><p>Perhaps the best thing about paying attention to "bad" shows is that you get to enjoy hating it along with many others, in the Internet era where being hateful is the norm, this is one of the few good things that stems from it. And speaking of connecting with others...</p><h2>Funny fandoms</h2><p>The best thing about being fixated on media is seeing the wonderful creations made by fans. During my Danganronpa fixation phase, I really enjoyed looking at all the memes and animations on Youtube, it was amazing how much quality art the community has made. The reasons I got into Danganronpa and Cookie Run was because of fan content, I loved seeing dumb memes. I've actually saved a fuck ton of Cookie Run fanart over the years, while I don't make much fanart (anymore), the fans often have a lot of creativity to make something pretty or funny, or both!</p><p>It's such a shame I couldn't find a suitable community for me in Blue Lock fandom, I'm not a fan of the community in Twitter, they focus too much on drama on other Blue Lock fans, I'm just here for the fictional guys.</p><hr><p>I haven't found a new fixation for a while, the closest is Umamusume but I didn't interact much with the fandom. I have been a bit understimulated lately, should I go find a new interest to submerge myself into?</p><div class="blogcredit"><h2>Credits/Reference:</h2><ul><li id="1">[1] <a href="#1b"><sup>^</sup></a>: The idiom frog under the well (井底之蛙) means knowing very little about the world and the surronding environment. I feel like that twist isn't that uncommon, and it would be embarrassing to say I see this twist the first time from a High Guardian Spice rewrite, but oh well.</li></ul></div><p class="date">( 14 Nov 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
