There are a lot that happened, lots of volunteers helping and giving resources unprompted, corruption which caused the incident to happen, people anxiously waiting for the missing people/pets, government and media somehow shifting the blame onto bamboo scaffolding despite the net being more flammable... I don't have the strength to talk about them in detail, but there should be a lot of posts about them in Instagram and Threads, and they might explain it better than I can. I just wish such incident will not happen again, and the government will actually find a proper prevention to this instead of caring more about the so called "national security".</p><hr><h2 style="color:red">Brief mention of mealworms</h2><p>The semester has ended, so I can spend more time sleeping at home. But after what happened, I couldn't rest well. I spent the whole day worrying about the future, and panicking that there is nothing I can do to improve the situation. Maybe talking about it will be better, but I'm the type of person who just shuts my mouth when I'm too upset, I don't like breaking down into tears.</p><p>There is one source of happiness though, which is that my sister got mealworms... Well mealworms scare me, but not hamsters. Hamsters are omnivores, they eat seeds, fruits and veggies, and they can eat bugs and meat as well. We often gave our hamsters dried mealworms in the past, but this is the first time we give our hamster live ones.</p><p>We are a bit scared of the squirmy worms though, so she grabbed one with chopsticks. Kuma (our current hamster), being a dumbass, didn't see the worm, but the chopstick holding it. He attacked the chopstick (he likes biting everything that moves ig) and dropped the mealworm. Idiot.</p><p>Second try, he did notice the worm this time, and we witnessed him attacking his food the most aggressively we've never seen before. While we know he loves dried mealworms, he was so absorbed into eating the worm, he would try stuff it into his mouth if we try to grab him. The worm might be a bit too big, as it takes quite a while for him to finish eating.</p><p>Seeing him eating well, it did make me feel a bit less scared about the future. Aside from all the news, there are also a lot of posts reminding Hongkongers to take a break from social media if needed. While this was exactly what I was doing the week before, I became so distressed after seeing the news, I couldn't relax if I try to do nothing, which I ended up using social media to numb myself.</p><p>Sorry about this blog being extremely unorganised, as my mind is very messy as well right now. I'm not sure how this incident will impact me and others in the long run, but right now I should find appropriate ways to make myself feel less scared.</p><p class="date">( 1 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
