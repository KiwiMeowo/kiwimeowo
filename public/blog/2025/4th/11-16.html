But fortunately this story has a happy ending.">Steve, Socks, and Spleen Surgery - An Animated Story</a></p><p>Mood: Alright</p><p>Random thought: I have been trying to think about other directions my OC lore can go instead of the main lines, I hope this can nudge my creative juices a bit</p></div><p class="blogtag"><span>Tags: Life, Vent</span></p><p>Growing up, the adults always say the Internet is dangerous, you don't see who is behind that wholesome Facebook profile, what if that is a serial murderer?</p><p>While the worry is justified, I always hated how everyone painted the Internet as this dangerous place with untrustworthy people lurking around. As you may know, I couldn't get along with my peers, they make fun of me, they exclude me in everything, I felt like an alien. Unlike real life, the Internet was so much friendlier, they don't look at you weird for just existing, they don't judge you for acting "impolite" or whatever. While rude people existed in the Internet, the kind people always outweigh the bad ones.</p><p>I remember the PSA videos my school showed about the Internet, they always show that you will get assaulted if you meet your Internet friend in real life. They also keep telling us that using too much computer is not good for you, and you should connect with real people more. Internet bad this, Internet bad that, if real life people is so good, I wouldn't have social anxiety from all the bullying. Therefore I always took the criticisms to Internet personally, and I would recklessly trust online strangers more (Honestly it is a shocker I never met any groomers back then).</p><p>And it was also because of that, I never understood why some people would want to quit the Internet. I've seen some people or celebrities take a break from social media for it is too stressful. I didn't understand why, the Internet is so fun and welcoming, why would you feel that way? I simply assumed those people are the same as the paranoid adults who say Internet is dangerous, and moved on.</p><hr><p>Many years passed, I have been in the Internet for a long time, though just a lurker. While there are many good things that happened to me in the Internet, like making friends in the Cookie Run fandom, the Internet seems to have become a bit less welcoming.</p><p>It feels a lot of difficult to get people to see my posts on social media. When I was still using social media to post stuff, I sometimes enjoy posting my art there. When I was somewhat new to drawing, I remember getting 20+ likes on Facebook, not much compared to viral posts, but it was still quite a lot to me, especially compared to how much I get in the future. As time goes on, my posts get barely any attention, especially if they are not fanart. There was one time I even said "Free art requests, put your refs below" on Facebook, and somehow get zero attention.</p><p>Second of all, like I have mentioned many times before in my blogs, it feels way less rewarding to scroll through social media with all the negative stuff being posted. While I might endure the stuff for my fandom content, I currently lost most interest in Cookie Run, and the Blue Lock fandom is kinda boring. Therefore, I found less reason to connect myself to social media, so what's the point of it anyways. So currently, I spend the most time on Neocities, and Instagram too cuz my friend is there.</p><p>Come to think of it, it feels somewhat sad how my relationship with Internet has dwindled. I think I now understand why some people would want to take a break from the Internet, I love how Internet raised me and gave me friends when the adults in my life kinda neglected me, but currently, even I feel like the negativity is too much.</p><p>But being in the Internet for so long, how do I even separate myself from it? So many people struggle with social media addiction, and I think I do have symptoms of this. I find it easy to put down my phone (as I don't like scrolling anymore), but when I look at my real world, I just realise that I don't have anything better to do. Actually, what do people who are in touch with real life even do? What do I do with all this extra time? So most of the times I try to disconnect, I just goes back to scrolling.</p><hr><p>I don't know what do extroverts actually do, but from pop media and shows, young people are often shown going to parties, drinking lots, dancing to loud ass music... I don't know if I would enjoy this, but I feel more like an outcast for not joining them. It might be peer pressure and FOMO speaking, but I feel worried if I am wasting my youth away <s>and I should start over life</s>.</p><p>But I realised that I am not completely alone in real life. Aside from my sister, who cared about me, I also have a friend that I kept in touch. He was one of my closest friends I have made, and we sometimes chat in Whatsapp. I enjoyed chatting with him, I sometimes missed hanging out with him. "Just ask him to hang out together"? But why would he want to hang out with me though? Would anyone actually want to hang out with me even? Even the kindest people I met looks at me like a lost child, and says they are busy if I do want to have lunch with them. I'm too afraid of rejection, I don't want to lose another friend.</p><p>But one day, somehow, I gathered the courage to ask him if we should get lunch together. And somehow, he said yes?? We haven't met in many years, so the conversation ended up being a bit awkward. And after that day, I thought he would think I'm strange or boring, and not fun to hang out with. But later on, he asked me to hang out again! I always worry I acted not normal enough, and yet, he didn't stop to hang out with me, he always said he enjoyed hanging out with me.</p><p>I always wished for someone who don't mind my presence, and see me as an equal and a friend instead of a special needs child. But seeing that I have a friend that is so patient with me... It is a bit scary. Something that I thought is only possible on the Internet or in my head, is now a possibility in real life. And I don't know how I should deal with this, a part of me is happy, but most of me is scared, anxious, and wants to run away. I don't want to accidentally mess up and make him notice how bad I am at being a normal human. What if this sudden good thing is a bad omen, or what if I suddenly lose this friendship, and I would become more lonely than ever?</p><p>My brain keeps going anxious mode, but I enjoyed the times I went to places with him. I often times don't know what to say with him, but it feels nice to know that someone is willing to spend time with me. As someone who used to be afraid of inviting people to hang out, it feels like a miracle that I finally get to do something despite all the trauma in my past.</p><p>After hanging out with my friend, I feel a bit less afraid of talking to old friends now. While it would be too ambitious to ask another old friend to hang out, I feel like I can at least send a message to those who treated me kindly. Will I one day be reconnected to real life people? Maybe not completely, real life people are dicks sometimes. But I hope the Internet will not be my only source of socialising in the future.</p><hr><p>While this question might not work since I'm asking you, who might possibly an chronic online person, what do you do if you can't scroll your phone in your free time? I don't know what hobby to try, or maybe I have completely looked past all the good choices. I just wish I have hobbies that aren't just drawing, coding and looking at Youtubers screaming in games.</p><p class="date">( 16 Nov 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
