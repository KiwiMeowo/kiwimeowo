I have plenty of colored pens in my collection, but I rarely use them as I draw with my pencil more. As a result, the pens becomes clogged up, and is basically not useable.</p><p>The solutions I found online are often:</p><ul><li>Put pen in hot water/alcohol</li><li>Heat up the pen</li><li>Blow air into the tube</li></ul><p>However, none of those worked, or the results lasted a very short amount of time. Looking at the cool pens I have, especially the ones with multi-colored ink, I feel very guilty about wasting them.</p><hr><p>So today, I saw a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSaGL_vjC5E/">Instagram reel</a>, a new solution where you stuff the tube with moldable eraser, pushing the ink out using the pressure. I was so excited to test this method, and guess what? It worked very well, the ink flowed better than when I first bought them (That might mean they get used up faster... But oh well I have to use them up at some point anyways). Even for the white pens (which ink is always very faint) they worked very well after I stuff the erasers into the tube.</p><p>So that concludes my very short blog post, I love any viewers here who owns lots of dried up pens can try this method.</p><p class="date">( 23 Dec 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
