Bad news: The screen faded into white, 95% of the screen does not show anything anymore. Good news: There is a emulator called Delta, which can be downloaded on our phones! My sister was delighted about this (Despite being the person who initially told me about this lmao), and downloaded several games, which included Partners in Time.</p><p>While I downloaded the emulator a while ago, I didn't really play this game as what I recalled in my childhood, it was difficult to beat. Moreover, Delta is a bit battery-consuming, I didn't really want it to eat up the batteries in the train. However, when I saw my sister playing some stages, and gave me try some of the gameplay, I was quite intrigued. So I decided to start my own run, and I beat it a few days ago.</p><hr><h2>The story</h2><p>The story of the gameplay is that Princess Peach tried out a time machine and went back in time, and unfortunately get caught by Princess Shroob. When Mario and Luigi went back to time to save her, they met their past baby selves. Now, they have to collect the Cobalt Star Shards, which powered the time machine and possibily the key to defeat the Princess Shroom.</p><p>I wasn't the type to keep track of Mario lore, as I see this franchise as a gameplay-centric series. However, the characters in the story are very charming, especially the main characters: Mario, Luigi and their baby selves. Among the gang, Luigi is the scardiest, even more so than his past self. There are several times Luigi tried to escape from the predicament, only to be stopped by something else.</p><p>One of my favourite scenes is that when the game fell into a cave, Luigi and Mario passed out, so the babies woke Luigi up with hammers. Luigi was quite mad about him using pain to wake him, which caused the babies cry. When Mario woke up, he was greeted with a sight where Luigi panickingly tried to comfort the crying babies. Mario was mad at Luigi for making the babies sad, which ended up making Luigi cry as well. My sister told me there is a comment on Youtube, which goes along like "In this game, Mario has to take care of three babies." I love how Luigi is the comic relief in this game.</p><p>I don't really have much complaints on the story, except for the most final boss. <span class="spoiler">Right after I defeat the big bad boss, the gang returned to the present, where everyone celebrated their victory. I was assuming that I reached the ending, but actually there is one more boss, where Bowser gets possessed by Princess Shroob. I think the mechanic is very cool, the player can never get to their turn and can only dodge attacks. However, I don't really enjoy the whiplash of tone. After the boss which I assumed was final, the tension I had was already gone. When they suddenly show this boss, with the background being the colorful happy Peach Castle, I was like "Huh, why is there another boss??"</span></p><hr><h2>The gameplay</h2><p>I don't think this is a game suitable for young kids, because it was very difficult. When I played it back then, it took me an extremely long time to beat a stage. When me and my sister got to Whomp Island, we got stuck just before the volcano, because we ran out of items, the boss was impossible to beat. We eventually gave up.</p><p>As I got smarter, the enemies are managable, but it is important to note the enemies attacks are almost impossible to predict. Each enemies attacks has different timings, and sometimes every time they attack, the timings will differ, possibly without audio/visual cues. Even if you have split second reaction, the attacks are difficult to avoid.</p><p>Moreover, it can be difficult to determine whether the attack is towards Mario or Luigi if they attack from above. The game is in 2d, the amount of depth perception is very limited. There might be a shadow on the character when an attack is about to land on them, but even then, it can be hard to parry when there's unusual timings like I mentioned above.</p><p>Because of these reasons, I often got dealt a lot of damage during battles, which can be very frustrating. I didn't die a lot during battles, but being repeatedly attacked is a bit discouraging. That being said, is there an hitless Partners in Time run? Not talking about no-damage boss videos.</p><p>Something that is not the fault of this game is clicking the buttons is a bit hard. As the buttons are in the screen instead of being physical, it is hard to accurately click the buttons without your sight constantly switching from the screen to your buttons. I sometimes fail the platforming maze because Delta assumed I clicked top-right arrow instead of top arrow, and I sometimes couldn't dodge an attack because it couldn't detect me clicking a button. I would recommend you to play this game (or just Delta in general) with a physical controller, or even a keyboard.</p><p>That aside, I found myself really enjoying the attack mechanics. For each round, when you attack as Mario/Luigi and their babies, you have to click their corresponding buttons. If you want a combo jump attack, you have to click Mario's attack [X] when he lands on the enemy, then click [A] when Mario lands. My favourite part has to be using the items, because each item has their own play style, and sometimes quite challenging as well. My sister struggled a bit with some items, and I had to help her out lol. The one I find most fun is Pocket Chomp and Copy Flower, which both requires the player to press on the landing character's buttons. Pocket Champ needs you to focus on two characters only, even if you miss once or twice, it is possible for the attack to keep going (Until the Chomp bites them on the butt). Copy Flower is harder, the attack immediately ends once you miss a button. But what I like about it is you can see around three characters before the landing, giving more processing time for your brain. It does take time to learn the combos, but where's the fun when there is no challenge (just... not too much, ok?)?</p><p>The map navigating part is very engaging as well. Each characters have their own unique abilities, like flying, whacking with hammer, rolling into a ball, being squished into pancakes... There are many parts in the map that requires you to use the abilities, making you use your brain instead of just making you walk around everywhere. A little nitpick is I wish the characters can sprint, though I can just dump the babies and make Mario and Luigi roll quickly, it is in the case if there is even a tube box, how do you even know?</p><hr><h2>Final impressions</h2><p>There are many childhood games I have replayed, and many of them I realised isn't actually very fun, or they simply isn't for my age anymore. Fortunately, Partners in Time is, in my opinion, a timeless game. Despite its difficulty, the story and gameplay is very charming. I really encourage you to play this game, if you have Iphone of course. Delta is not available for Android at this moment, and if you are using Android... Let me enjoy some Schadenfreude *Point and laugh*.</p><center><h2>Score: 9/10</h2></center><p class="date">( 26 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
