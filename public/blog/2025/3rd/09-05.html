So let's talk about them in more detail!</p><hr><h2><span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span></h2><p>The <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span> I'm talking about includes green <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span> and the round <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span>. They are a bit different, but I love both of them.</p><p>I didn't exactly hate <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span> when I was a kid, but I felt they aren't necessary to <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE</span>. <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span> used to feel like decorations more than something with <span class="weird">EFF-EL-AY-VEE-OH-YOU-AR</span>, and I often skip <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span> stuff which feels redundant to <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE</span>, gotta save energy for something worthy.</p><p>When I grew older, something clicked in my head while I was eating pasta with <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span>, and I decided to give it a <span class="weird">BEE-IYE-TEE-EE</span>. And that moment, I noticed the slight fragrance and pleasant sting in my mouth. From that on, I became obsessed with <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span> <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span>.</p><p>I really like it when <span class="weird">AR-EE-ES-TEE-AY-YOU-AR-AY-EN-TEE-ES</span> put a lot of <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span> into their <span class="weird">DEE-IYE-ES-AECH-EE-ES</span>. There is a place I often to go, and after I finish the <span class="weird">EN-OH-OH-DEE-EL-EE-ES</span>, there will be some green <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span> left in the <span class="weird">ES-OH-YOU-PEE</span>. My favourite part is to enjoy the green <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span> with the <span class="weird">ES-OH-YOU-PEE</span>.</p><p>I also went to a <span class="weird">PEE-OH-KAY-EE</span> bowl place, and I like to order <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span> into my bowl. It hurts my mouth a bit, and one time it burnt my mouth when I ordered too much, but I really enjoyed the <span class="weird">SEE-AR-YOU-EN-SEE-AECH-IYE-EN-EE-ES-ES</span> and <span class="weird">ES-DOUBLEU-EE-EE-TEE-EN-EE-ES-ES</span>.</p><p>I also went to a <span class="weird">AR-AY-EM-EE-EN</span> place that has <span class="weird">AR-AY-EM-EE-EN</span> with a mountain of green <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span>. I was quite excited, but I was disappointed to realise the green <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span> doesn't <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE</span> that strong, it just felt like <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span> <span class="weird">EFF-EL-AY-VEE-OH-YOU-AR-EL-EE-ES-ES</span> grass.</p><h2><span class="weird">GEE-AY-AR-EL-IYE-SEE</span></h2><p>TBH I really enjoyed <span class="weird">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span> which brings out fragrance, so I really liked <span class="weird">GEE-AY-AR-EL-IYE-SEE</span> as well. Unlike <span class="weird">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span>, I liked <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span> <span class="weird">GEE-AY-AR-EL-IYE-SEE</span> since I was very young. I remember I conversation in my childhood that went like this:</p><blockquote><p>Someone: <span class="weird" style="text-transform:capitalize">GEE-AY-AR-EL-IYE-SEE</span> is very good for your health, and it helps lower your blood pressure!</p><p>Me: But what if I have low blood pressure?</p><p>Someone: Then you should not <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE</span> them.</p><p>Me: NOOOOOOO</p></blockquote><p>When I <span class="weird">SEE-OH-OH-KAY</span>, I sometimes add more <span class="weird">GEE-AY-AR-EL-IYE-SEE</span> into the <span class="weird">DEE-IYE-ES-AECH-EE-ES</span>. Sometimes I <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE</span> them, but they can burn my mouth, badly. Ouch, still <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-WHY</span> though.</p><h2><span class="weird">SEE-IYE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-AR-OH</span></h2><p>This might be a controversial opinion, but I kinda like <span class="weird">SEE-IYE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-AR-OH</span>. I wasn't the type to <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE</span> it when I see it on the table, but I don't hate it like some people do. Apparently, some people get the soap gene which makes <span class="weird">SEE-IYE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-AR-OH</span> <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE</span> like soap, but luckily I don't have it.</p><p>Sometimes, the <span class="weird">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span> I order has <span class="weird">SEE-IYE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-AR-OH</span>, and I sometimes <span class="weird">SEE-AECH-EE-DOUBLEU</span> on it. While it <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE-ES</span> a bit grassy, but it isn't unpleasant, I find it quite... enjoyable? I feel kinda tempted to buy those <span class="weird">DEE-IYE-ES-AECH-EE-ES</span> which contain a fuck ton of <span class="weird">SEE-IYE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-AR-OH</span>, I hope my sister doesn't look at me weird lol.</p><h2>Baby <span class="weird">SEE-AY-BEE-BEE-AY-GEE-EE-ES</span></h2><p>I don't mind eating <span class="weird">VEE-EE-GEE-GEE-IYE-EE-ES</span>, though I do have preferences in how <span class="weird">SEE-OH-OH-KAY-EE-DEE</span> they are, I prefer it is on the softer side, I don't like <span class="weird">VEE-EE-GEE-GEE-IYE-EE-ES</span> that are too crunchy and have that greeny <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE</span>.</p><p>Anyways, I found myself to be addicted to <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span> baby <span class="weird">SEE-AY-BEE-BEE-AY-GEE-EE-ES</span> ever since university or smth. I remember one day my sister <span class="weird">SEE-OH-OH-KAY-EE-DEE</span> baby <span class="weird">SEE-AY-BEE-BEE-AY-GEE-EE-ES</span> for <span class="weird">DEE-IYE-EN-EN-EE-AR</span>. I was like "Mmm this <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE-ES</span> good", and after that I came to love baby <span class="weird">SEE-AY-BEE-BEE-AY-GEE-EE-ES</span>.</p><p>It is extremely great that I found a <span class="weird">AR-EE-ES-TEE-AY-YOU-AR-AY-EN-TEE</span> which has baby <span class="weird">SEE-AY-BEE-BEE-AY-GEE-EE-ES</span>, it is soaked in <span class="weird">ES-OH-YOU-PEE</span> (very <span class="weird">EFF-EL-AY-VEE-OH-YOU-AR-EFF-YOU-EL</span>) and is very soft, completely my cup of tea (it is just a idiom so no need to censor it maybe).</p><p>I sometimes <span class="weird">SEE-OH-OH-KAY</span> when I don't feel like going out, few days ago I made baby <span class="weird">SEE-AY-BEE-BEE-AY-GEE-EE-ES</span>, and after <span class="weird">SEE-OH-OH-KAY-IYE-EN-GEE</span> the <span class="weird">JAY-YOU-IYE-SEE-EE</span> will leak out of the baby <span class="weird">SEE-AY-BEE-BEE-AY-GEE-EE-ES</span>. After <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span>, I decided to <span class="weird">DEE-AR-IYE-EN-KAY</span> the <span class="weird">JAY-YOU-IYE-SEE-EE</span> (cuz why not), and it <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE-DEE</span> so gooddddd, it would be banger if I made it into <span class="weird">ES-OH-YOU-PEE</span>.</p><h2><span class="weird">EE-GEE-GEE-PEE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-ES</span></h2><p>I used to not like <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span> them, not because they <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE-DEE</span> bad, it's just they look weird. Blue or purple <span class="weird">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span> does not look good to <span class="weird">EE-AY-TEE</span>, so my picky ass did not want to give <span class="weird">EE-GEE-GEE-PEE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-ES</span> a try.</p><p>I mentioned the story back in 5 Jan 2024, a friend ordered a <span class="weird">DEE-IYE-ES-AECH</span> with <span class="weird">EE-GEE-GEE-PEE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-ES</span>, and I surprisingly liked it. It is soft and a bit <span class="weird">ES-DOUBLEU-EE-EE-TEE</span>, but it was also <span class="weird">ES-EE-AY-ES-OH-EN-EE-DEE</span> very nicely. Only then I realised <span class="weird">EE-GEE-GEE-PEE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-ES</span> <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE-DEE</span> better than they look.</p><hr><p>While growing up I am able to tolerate more <span class="weird">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span>, there are some that I could not like not matter how much I try.</p><h2><span class="weird">EM-YOU-ES-AECH-AR-OH-OH-EM-ES</span></h2><p>This excludes <span class="weird">EE-EN-OH-KAY-IYE</span> <span class="weird">EM-YOU-ES-AECH-AR-OH-OH-EM-ES</span>.</p><p>I have attempted to try <span class="weird">EM-YOU-ES-AECH-AR-OH-OH-EM-ES</span> multiple times, and I only enjoy them if they don't have that strange earthy <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE</span>. I remember ordering <span class="weird">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span> which contains <span class="weird">EM-YOU-ES-AECH-AR-OH-OH-EM-ES</span>, and I decided to give it a try.</p><p>Upon one <span class="weird">BEE-IYE-TEE-EE</span>, I thought it <span class="weird">TEE-AY-ES-TEE-EE-DEE</span> fine, <span class="weird">SEE-AECH-EE-DOUBLEU-WHY</span> and <span class="weird">ES-AY-VEE-OH-YOU-AR-WHY</span>. And another few seconds later, a VERY putrid <span class="weird">EFF-EL-AY-VEE-OH-YOU-AR</span> spread in my mouth. Yea, I don't think I would like <span class="weird">EM-YOU-ES-AECH-AR-OH-OH-EM-ES</span> anytime soon.</p><hr><p>It's kinda annoying to write this type of blog, I have to go convert some words into this weird format, then paste it back. Also since I can't really read the text until I decode it back, I can't really check the progress of my writing very well. It is kinda funny though lol.</p><p>After writing today's blog, I noticed I might not have used a lot of the letter 'z'. So, uhh,</p><p><span class="weird">ZEE-YOU-SEE-SEE-AECH-IYE-EN-IYE</span></p><center><button onclick="normal()" class="coolbutton">Click here to understand the sacred words</button></center><script src="../../BotsDontLookAtIt.js"></script><p class="date">( 5 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
