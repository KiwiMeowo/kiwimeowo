If I count the times that don’t require planes to travel, I don’t think I can remember how many times I had trips anymore. But if I only count the ones that I stayed longer then one day, then it would be five times, South Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, Tokyo and Guangzhou. There were a variety of stuff to do in each places, but there is one thing that I feel the same: I felt extremely exhausted.</p><p>I always felt like I didn’t go on enough trips when I was a kid, I heard peers often go on other countries in holidays or for study tours, and yet I never travelled overseas back then. My sister had gone on trips a little more than me, I was quite jealous about that.</p><p>I had my first plane travel to South Korea, I was in primary school, and it was so long ago that I don’t remember much about the details. The part I remember the most is it snowed on the last day I stayed there, it didn’t last long and it was quite small, but it was the first time I’ve seen snow, and it was so cool.</p><p>A few years later, around the time I’m still playing CROB, I went to Tainan (I think) with my sister and cousins. Not having travelled for a long time, I felt very strange being in a different country, I’m not very used to speaking in a language aside from Cantonese to people, and the scenery feels very different from Hong Kong. However, I really enjoy the variety of food I got to eat there.</p><p>The next trip was Okinawa, which I have written in my blog before. One of the places which I wanted to travel to the most was Japan (Child me heard the food is cheaper and very delicious), and somehow I got the university subsidy for a study tour in Okinawa. The trip took a strange turn when the return flight got delayed due to typhoon, and we got to stay three days extra. It’s got to be my favourite trip of all, the food was very awesome, the study tour was a good balance of learning stuff and free time, and the environment was relatively peaceful. Compared to most other places I’ve been to, Okinawa seemed to be less croweded and busy, there wasn’t really a time we needed to queue for ages or stand in a crowd (or maybe it was because the school carefully planned for us). I really enjoyed the feeling of walking in a quiet street while enjoying a good breakfast.</p><p>Last year summer, me and my sister went to Tokyo. There were plenty of stuff to buy, I bought a bunch of Blue Lock merch, like holy shit I can’t believe I got to be fed with merch of my fav characters. I also got to meet the statue (is it what it’s called?) of the blue lockers who scored in the vs U20 match. In my past fandom experiences, all the cool events in the fandom are all out of my reach, and I only got to see the fans having fun through the screen. And this time, finally, I can meet Barou with my own eyes.</p><p>And very recently, I travelled to Guangzhou for work. It’s very cool to have this internship, especially the fact they paid for the food, travel fees and apartments, and the rooms are big as fuck!! And each interns got to have their own rooms??? wow. It was quite enjoyable to hang out with the other interns, it felt like it has been ages sonce the last time I got to interact with people of the same age.</p><p>Despite how fun travelling can be, one major downside of them is that they are incredibly exhausting. When you travel to another country, it’s usually quite different from the place you live. The streets look different, the buildings look different, the language people speak are different, and even the air feels different. It always feels disorienting to wake up in a place where almost everything isn’t the same as it feels at home. It seems like every time I return home from a trip, I always feel very burnt out and sleep through the next day.</p><p>While it is fun to travel, I enjoy spending my holidays recharging myself, not stressing myself with trip schedules and trying to adapt to a new place. People have been asking me if I want to travel somewhere before school starts, but idk I kinda want to spend my free time chilling on my bed. But if I have to choose where to travel, I think I want to visit Okinawa again, it felt very nice there.</p><p>Man I really wish I’m in an holiday, internship makes me sleepy.</p><p class="date">( 8 Jul 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
