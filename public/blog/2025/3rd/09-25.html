While it's kinda a bummer there is no second holiday, I'm glad the typhoon is over so that the damages can be lessened.</p><p>I mentioned that my bedroom was leaking water last blog, I spent some time to tidy up the stuff to clean up the mess (and also because I will be getting a new bed soon). Something unfortunate is that there is a leaflet on how to take care of a sick child, which I believe was back from when I was a toddler, and it was soaked with water. The pages got stuck together, so the pictures and text became messed up. While I have no use for it, it is kinda a shame a fragment of my past got damaged due to my negligence.</p><p>Anyways, aside from the somewhat small leakages, there are no other damages. Everything went normally in my home. It is easy to assume that the typhoon isn't that big of a deal the fact I spent the whole day being fine, but just from searching the news, I immediately knew it caused a lot of damage outside. There are buildings which glass broke from the wind. Trees collapsed from the wind, some even fell onto passerbys. There are many firefighters and medical staff who continued working to handle all the accidents occuring during that day. There are many people who struggled a lot during the typhoon, I'm quite glad I didn't encounter any major bad stuff.</p><p>Today when I was going to school, I see a lot of fallen leaves and branches, and sometimes broken umbrellas. This kind of sight only happens after a big typhoon, it really makes me wonder when another big typhoon like Rasaga will be coming soon, considering how many extreme weathers happened this year. I like holidays, but I hope it is not at the cost of people's endangerment.</p><p class="date">( 25 Sep 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
