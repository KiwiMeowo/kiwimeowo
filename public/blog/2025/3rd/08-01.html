I have heard of this game for a long time, but I never really cared about it, I mean it’s just horses as anime girls. Also, my sister somewhat recently wanted to watch the anime, but we kinda lost interest on the half way of the very first episode, the vibe didn’t feel it was the one for us. Moreover, I’m never a fan of the idol genre (certain childhood idol anime which traumatised me), which Pretty Derby kinda is.</p><p>Recently, the game released the English version, which caused a surge of popularity in the English speaking community. I know that because the creator of Horse Race Tests kept mentioning this game. I didn’t care much until I came across this <a href="https://x.com/maiko_11_11/status/1938623654209704319" target="_blank">tweet</a>:</p><blockquote><p>My dear followers I wanna tell u something very important and something I believe a lot of you need to hear:</p><p>Don't worry too much about meta, good runs, winning every race.</p><p>My advice is: just have fun!</p></blockquote><p>I was somewhat confused about the statement. As a cookie run player, there’s always a character that is meta, and the rest of the cookies are forgotten in the basement. And I’m pretty sure this also applies to majority of the gacha games, so I think that is a very bold statement. Like technically you can use a non meta character in games, it’s just you will get shitty results and rewards. So in Cookie Run terms, does that statement mean I can use Pome and still get a decent amount of score, or would I be stuck below top 50% forever?</p><p>Anyways, that tweet made me decide to check that game out for myself, just to see if the tweet is genuine or the op is being idiotic.</p><hr><p>Pretty Derby is a gacha game featuring horse girls that are based of real life race horses. To train your characters, you have to train them and put them in races in a three-year program (each training round equals to half month). You have to accomplish the goal of the character, which can be different depending on who you picked. After the training, you can use the built character in various events.</p><p>Knowing almost nothing about the characters, I didn’t know which I should train first since most of the designs (at least the ones I got) didn’t interest me very much. However, I rolled a character that looks really cool, which is Air Shakur, I was like “Alright you’re the one”.</p><p>Air Shakur acts distant and sometimes harsh, she always brings her laptop around and use a program called Parcae to predict her performance in future races. However, it predicts a race that she will lose to a horse girl by 7cm, and her performance will go down hill from there. So my goal is help her change the future and become stronger.</p><p>When it was time to race, I was quite nervous about her being at the back (I was not aware the her strat is being at the back). When I thought all hope is lost, I saw her run to the front in an insane speed. I thought people were joking when they got hyped for their horse, but man I was so excited when she won 1st place. I mentioned that I did not enjoy idol stuff, but when I see Air Shakur singing at the center of the stage, I was so ecstatic in a way I thought was impossible for my cold dead heart (?).</p><img src="https://i.makeagif.com/media/8-11-2017/seP3qc.gif"><center>That's my horse!</center><p>One thing I gotta warn though, if you are playing a new character, especially if you are a new player, it might take a very long time to finish a training. Pretty Derby is not only a gacha game, but a visual novel. Not only that, each character has their own character arc, which may take a while to read.</p><p>After finishing Air Shakur’s training, I felt that it is very fun to train the horses. So far, I have trained Gold Ship, Rice Shower, Sakura Bakushin O, and many others. If it weren’t the fact I’m focusing on AF, I would play this game more.</p><p>After playing the game, what do I think about the meta? While I’m still not familiar with the meta, I feel like it isn’t very important about which horse to pick. As a casual player, it feels like the focus of the game isn’t to pick a strong chracter, but the process of building and bonding with the character. I mean that is the main game mode, the stuff that requires you to use the built characters are the side stuff.</p><p>The characters have special reactions depending how they performed in the race, and I feel especially bad if they lose. I’m not sure how the developers did it, but when a character performs bad, I don’t go “man this character isn’t good”, I go “God I’m a failure of a trainer, I couldn’t get her to win”. Some of the characters might also get in a race which is designed to be difficult to win. In a certain race, Air Shakur gains a debuff called 99 problems, and I still haven’t gotten her to win that race. Maybe if I get better stats, I can get her to win…</p><p>I think the most meta heavy thing in the game is the support cards. In Twitter, the fans always emphasise that there is no meta horse, and you can just pick whatever character you want. For support cards, the other hand, they often go “I MUST GET KITASAN BLACK”. I don’t know which cards I should use more, but I was sad to see the Air Shakur card is very bad for gameplay :(.</p><p>I think the part that surprises me the most is the amount of effort the devs put into the game. Each characters’ personalities or traits are based off their real life counterparts, which requires plenty of research (and permission from the trainers). I really like the easter eggs of the head accessories's location are hints on whether the horse the girls are based on are male or female.</p><p>The visuals are fantastic as well, the 3d animations of the characters are very lively and natural. I’m very surprised how for some song tracks, there is a version for every horse VA, I’m pretty sure even Air Shakur also sang Umapyoi Densetsu.</p><p>This game has far exceeded my expectations, but maybe it’s just in the perspective of a casual newbie.</p><p>One final thing, I find it funny that there's a song where Sakura Bakushin O just sings "Bakushin" over and over again, and somehow two lyricists are involved in the making of this.</p><iframe class="yt" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WttUxO0EooA?si=aYQiYnkcUtj1ZNeg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><p class="date">( 1 Aug 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
