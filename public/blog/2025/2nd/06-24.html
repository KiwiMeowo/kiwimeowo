I don&rsquo;t remember which theme I wanted the most, maybe Destruction vs Creation? But I don&rsquo;t think I placed Fossils vs Crystals very high, at least Time vs Space didn&rsquo;t win, Space is a bit too similar to Stardust.</p><p>As I have mentioned, I am having an internship, and it ends in August, that means I have to allocate time to draw while I am busy with work. I can either work on the drawings during weekends (ideal time), or after work (I will be exhausted). Either way, I will have significantly less time to draw compared to last year, which I got to work on attacks almost every day.</p><p>Nevertheless, I will try my best, and maybe bring some notepads to do attacks when I&rsquo;m free.</p><p>In case you are a first year Art Fighter, I have a few tips:</p><h2>Preparing your characters:</h2><ul><li>Write down any character permissions you want to set (no genderbending, no gore etc)</li><li>Upload your characters before AF starts, AF website gets very unstable at the beginning of the event.</li><li>Avoid changing character perms, refs, or hiding characters after AF starts. This is to avoid people doing an attack for your character then realising something&rsquo;s outdated after they have already worked on it</li></ul><h2>Preparing to attack:</h2><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t start your attacks before AF starts!! This is against the rules and the spirit of AF</li><li>Bookmark lots of characters you wanna draw</li><li>Just before AF starts, save the refs whose owners have already picked teams. AF website tends to crash right after it starts, you might not be able to access them through the website.</li><li>Check character perms and ask the owners if you are not sure about some permissions</li><li>If you have to take pictures of your physical art, remember to remove the metadata, it might have your address</li><li>Revenges are appreciated but not mandatory, if you do attacks, don&rsquo;t expect for a revenge, and you are not required to revenge if someone attacks you</li><li>Take breaks!!!! Drawing for a long time can hurt your hands, eyes and body, you might also get burnt out. So remember to stretch, and don&rsquo;t feel rushed to do attacks.</li></ul><p>So, what&rsquo;s new for this year? I managed to make two OC refs this year: Wolf and Mistic. Wolf is the last member to be part of the main character group, a bit arrogant, dumb, but is resilient even against the most despairing scenarios. And Mistic&hellip; isn&rsquo;t part of any major story, but is something I have been planning in a project I have been doing. All I can tell you now is Mistic is some sort of online sona he uses.</p><p>I also changed the format of my introduction<span>&nbsp; </span>and OC descriptions in AF. While I used to use tables, as they looked fancy in desktop, they actually look awful in mobile devices. I decided to remove the tables and added some decorations. It took a bit of work, but they look pretty now, I really like the stars.</p><p>What is my goal for this AF? Surpassing my last record of 74 attack will be quite difficult, so I will just hope I get to draw at least two small sketches during weekdays, and one probably higher quality drawing during weekends. After some calculations, my goal is attack 44 characters, I should remind myself to not worry myself about reaching that goal tho.</p><p>Managed to finish the Art Fight cover today, I love my OCs they are so silly</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ssi2lxzipbi9apurcwhun/IMG_4143_20250624.PNG?rlkey=5ojd7mqdetjsxiez27iqaof1p&raw=1"><p class="date">( 24 Jun 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
