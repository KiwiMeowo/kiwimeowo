The moment the gates of the race opened, the horses sprinted towards to obstacle-filled maze, desperately finding the correct path. They use all their might to reach the goal, the carrot sitting in a room far away. It is not just about a tasty treat, it is about honor, a title, a name they all wanted and crave…</p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIwODU4MjE4LmdpZg==/original/W%2FxZPA.gif"><p>Yea I was confused as well when I first heard about this series. There has been fanart going around Twitter, and people being excited over the horses. But when I saw the source material, the artstyle is quite strange, and the horses don&rsquo;t really look like horses, just blobs.</p><p>This series is made by snakeandrews on Twitter, the videos of HRT are posted regularly, and is still ongoing. The series is somewhat similar to the bouncing DVD logo, the horses move in random directions, when they hit a wall, they bounce into another way. To be a winner, they have to reach the carrot (or other items), and they will be given a name if they still have their default color name. And everytime, people would bet on the horse they think will win this race.</p><p>This reminds me of those marble race videos I used to watch, you bet on a marble, then the marbles will be sent to an obstacle cource. These videos have a certain appeal, but how do people become so invested in this series, and even get attached to the horses? Actually, this series does not just depend on luck and entropy, the author and the community also added story elements to the races.</p><p>While you think this type of videos are all random, there are some common themes in all the races. Jovial Merriment, the orange horse, has the highest win rate, people regard her (The gender of the horses is up to interpretation, and a lot of people see them as female) as the GOAT.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyan, is the horse who never won a name, she also nearly won in an early race, but her victory is snatched by Yellow (Currently known as Lightning Strikes Thrice) in front of her eyes. After that match, Cyan is depicted with a frown.</p><p>Lightning Strikes Thrice, like mentioned above, managed to win against Cyan. After that match, she is depicted with a grin. And for some reason, when she was given a name, her name was often covered by a bird, and whenever her name is mentioned, it will be covered by bird noises. Also she is considered Jovial&rsquo;s girlfriend after that one match they made out in a room (and Jovial still won lmao).</p><p>Comely Material Morning, the pink horse, is a horse added later on. At the beginning, she does not perform very well, always very far behind when everyone else is mid way through the race. However, the only times when she excels a race is when the reward is an apple. She is my favourite horse, only locking in when there are apples involves is so cute. Also she has the best win jingle.</p><iframe class="yt" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCML7FBPkGA?si=GP_68pMO9MrbnpNH&amp;start=32" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Superstitional Realism, the white horse, is the last horse (before Cyan) to win her first match. Because she used to won 0 matches just like Cyan, people view them as close friends. They may might far behind their peers, but at least they have each other.</p><p>In one race, very strangely, only Cyan and White was in the room. The two worst horses, placed in a square room connected to another, with a carrot at the end. In that moment, the two horses knew, between the two friends, only one of them can win a title.</p><p>Maybe because they didn&rsquo;t want to cause the loss of their friend, or maybe because they sucked at racing, it took them a long time to even get through the mid point. And eventually, a winner emerged, White claimed the title of Superstitional Realism.</p><p>Later, Cyan found herself in a empty room, no mazes, obstacles or even rivals, just a lone carrot waiting to be obtained. She grabbed the carrot, a win jingle is played, and yet the victory is hollow. The textbox normally containing the title of the horse was shown, &ldquo;Cyan&rdquo;. No new name was given to her, as if the race itself was making fun of her incompetence. What is the point of a pity prize anyway?</p><p>SR (Superstitional Realism) was in a strange room again, but this time, she was battling against A Mysterious Figure. That horse looks eerily like her, but her appearance was twisted. People suspected that A Mysterious Figure was SR&rsquo;s inner demons, a manifestation of her own guilt of leaving Cyan behind. Fortunately, despite being haunted by her own mind, SR managed to win the course.</p><p>The unusual chain of events had not stopped yet. This time, SR has to fight against more unusual looking horse, and this time there&rsquo;s another more familiar figure: Jovial Merriment. JM is the top player among the horses, how did she end up here..? The race started, and JM ended up in a rough spot, she was stuck in a corner, unable to move. And even though JM had won many races, she couldn&rsquo;t claim the victory in this realm.</p><p>Horse Race Tests Tournament, the race that people most anticipated for, had started. While the people cheered for the horse, they noticed something uncanny, three of the horses trapped in the dark realm came back to the world twisted, JM now is called Fearsome Fate, SR is now Fantasy Fantasy Fantasy, and Cyan is OOB (why this name??). Despite the strangeness, the race continued on like normal.</p><p>Many great things happened during this tournament, this is when Yellow got her name of Lightning Stikes Thrice, and when Door Knob (Brown) broke the record of the fastest horce match won, and Comely Material Morning nearly winning then left because she found out the reward is raddishes and no apples.</p><p>Who claimed the victory of this tournament? Even when her body was beaten and tattered, even when she lost her grand title of joy, the victor never backed down. Fearsome Fate won the tournament.</p><p>There are a lot of speculation on what happened. The common idea is that the nightmare horses are the corrupted forms of Cyan, who fell into despair after losing over and over again. But as to what happened to the match with SR, JM and the nightmare horses, there are different theories. Some said the nightmare horses corrupted the two, and they are not the same. Some say the two saved Cyan by letting one of the nightmare horses win. There is no definitive answer, since this story is all up to interpretation.</p><p>For me, I have my own theory. I always found it strange that JM ended up in that realm, especially since she&rsquo;s the top winner, it doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense. So what if the reason she&rsquo;s there is because of SR? After SR won the race against Cyan, a title was not the only thing she won, and also a choice to drag a player down to the nightmare realm. Even if SR gets to return to the world like normal, she might get overshadowed again by the stronger players. If that&rsquo;s the case, why not help the weaker ones by removing a strong player? So she chose the one with the highest win rate: JM.</p><p>I mentioned that SR was supposed to return to the normal world, but as we know, she didn&rsquo;t, so why is that? I imagined that the manifestation of guilt back then, was not just for Cyan. She may not like JM winning almost every time, pulling her down with the losers feels very unjust. Even if choosing JM as the unlucky one is the realistic choice, she couldn&rsquo;t help but blame herself for being so cruel&hellip;</p><p>Like I said, there can be many interpretations of the story. And you don&rsquo;t have to like my interpretation, especially since this frames SR as a very bad person, which I don&rsquo;t think many would enjoy.</p><p>While most of the lore we found were based off a lot of assumptions, it is not only the community that made it so good. Snakeandrews, the creator of the series, is the one who added bits of lore seeds into the games. He also engages with the community a lot, including giving the horses different silhouettes to help color blind people differentiate between them. To makes a series successful, it requires the care and love of the creator.</p><p>Currently, the first arc has finished, the current arc is mostly about basketballing. JM isn&rsquo;t there for some reason, but now the main focus seems to be on Comely and Door Knob, the leaders of their respective teams. Being a Comely fan, I really look forward to the new matches. I wonder what will happen to Nighttime Knifemare&hellip;</p><p class="date">( 25 Jun 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
