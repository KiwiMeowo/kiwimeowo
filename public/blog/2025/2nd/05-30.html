I wasn't a fan of alcohol, beer tastes god awful, the sweeter soju just tastes like juice, and non-alcoholic juice was just suffice. So I didn't really get the appeal.</p><p>Today, me and several relatives went to a fancy restaurant, and they ordered some alcoholic beverages for me. There's one with mango milk foam on top, one that tastes fruity, and one that looks like chamgane (idk how to spell it but im not correcting typos ffrom now on im too eepy). The first one tastes very good, I'm a fan of cheesy/milky food, and the drink just hits my spot. It has a hint of alcohol, but this time it enhances the experience, makes my throat kinda warm. I quickly finished the drink, like man i didn't know alcohol can taste this good. The second tastes fruity, it is somewhat similar to the first one without the milm foam, tastes good still.</p><p>The third one however, tastes worse than beer. However, since everyone is drinking it, it feels like a waste to not drink it. I managed to finish it though.</p><p>In my past experiences of drinking alcohol, I've never gotten drunk. I think it was because I finish the drink in the span of many hours, that it was a bit difficult to get drunk. This time however, I finished them all within two hours. My feeling right now is that I feel kinda eepy, and my mind feels kinda excited about everything.</p><p>The food there tastes very good, while usually when i visit restaurants, when ordering multiple dishes, some taste good, some taste meh. This restaurant however has like 6/7 of the food taste very good. On the other hand, I find it kinda strange and funny how excited my mind is over the dishes, everytime I ate the food, I was like "god DAMN IT TASTES SO BANGER!!1!!!111" Like I know I love food, I have never gotten this intense I think. Yea I figured I might be a bit drunk, considering I'm also feeling a bit eepy and out of focus.</p><p>It is a funny experience which I will need to record down, just to be mindful the next time I have alcohol. The signs of being drunk can be useful to stop myself from drinkign too much. Anyways, time to shower and eep</p><p class="date">( 30 May 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
