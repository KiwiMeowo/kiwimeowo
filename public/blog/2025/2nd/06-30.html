Remember the days when a class was nearing its end, and you kept praying “Don’t have dictation please…”, then the teacher says “Dictation next week!”, and you cried in pain? As a university student, I certainly don’t miss the days of having to memorise Chinese poems and English essays.</p><p>For certain dictations, there was a thing called bonus scores, giving you more points to reach 100. They are usually more difficult, you aren’t bad if you don’t get the points (unless if you are a tryhard), but if you get them right, you are definitely the smart ones. Getting them wrong won’t deduct you scores, but getting them right gives you more, perhaps even help you reach 100 more easily.</p><p>While they sound nice theoretically, but somehow, at least in my class, somehow the max score got expanded to 105 (100 default max score + bonud score). Perhaps in the eyes of perfectionists, they also have to get the extra questions perfect.</p><p>However, by expanding the max score, it completely defeats the purpose of bonus scores. The point of bonus scores is that it is BONUS, and by making them part of the max scores, they aren’t bonus anymore. If someone gets everything correct but the bonus questions, as soon as the max score is 100, they still get 100%. But if the max score includes the bonus scores, it will be 100/105 (95%), making them suffer from the points that are meant to be optional.</p><p>This has been bothering me since primary school, whenever I see scores that exceed 100 from the bonus score, I felt very bothered. I think if a person gets all questions correct, including bonuses, the max score they can get should only be 100. If a student really want to see if they got the bonuses, just write 100+5->100. You might ask “Is the difference that big?” Well to 10 year old me, yes. I like to take everything a bit too seriously.</p><p class="date">( 30 Jun 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
