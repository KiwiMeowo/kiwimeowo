Of course, <u>this blog will contain spoilers for chapter 9.</u></p><p>Hollyberry is known to be the Ancient "with the least trauma", she loves her family, has a lot of friends, and seems to be outgoing and happy. Because of her personality and her kingdom being mostly safe compared to others, many of the fans thought she does not have any trauma from the war. I think I thought of that very early on, in the blog of 13 Jun 2024:</p><blockquote><p>"To describe, it is like Hollyberry Cookie in the Ancient team, you wouldn't call her backstory 0% pain, but the other ancient's story is outstandingly traumatic, from losing your son to a cursed sword, to godhood fuckery."</p><p style="text-align:right">- Kiwi from 2024, a sweet summer child</p></blockquote><p>People did mention Hollyberry's alcoholism, which might have been problematic. However, Hollyberry Kingdom has a culture of drinking a lot of wine, and also Hollyberry has an extremely high tolerance for alcohol, it's probably impossible for her to get drunk, so not everyone thought this is a problem.</p><p>And with that, since every story for Hollyberry so far has been quite smooth-sailing, people are starting to worry this time she would suffer a lot. And in the background for the Shadow Milk update title screen, Hollyberry's cardboard cutout is shown is be sad, so people think her chapter is going to be very rough on her. As a Hollyberry fan, though I feel pain when I see my favourite characters suffer, but content is content, I will eat them up with love.</p><hr><p>So the story starts with Hollyberry with many soldiers and bodyguards, including Wildberry and Raspberry, venturing to Beast Yeast. They also encounters Tiger Lily, who's actually Hollyberry's long missing granddaughter, but they don't know yet. Fighting off the monsters, many soldiers got injured. Suddenly, a little cupid-like cookie named Pavlova Cookie appeared. Pavlova peered within the Hollyberrians hearts, saying that Raspberry yearns for a passionate love just like how her cousin did, Wildberry has a love that is hard to work out but doesn't want to give up, Tiger Lily's butter tiger has a crush (Tiger Lily: ?). But when Pavlova looked into Hollyberry's heart, he said her heart is cold and empty...? Hollyberry is known is be a very loving queen to everyone, no way this reading is correct, right?</p><p>Anyways, Pavlova decides to send the Hollyberrians to a peaceful land, where they meets the Bringer of Happiness face to face, which they didn't know yet is the villainous Beast, Eternal Sugar, they are looking for.</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ron9fxrkftmjrck28osah/IMG_3758_20250508.jpg?rlkey=dzvejkfr9w36gdnsbbl9h17zf&st=kdev5m7f&raw=1"><center>Why are you gae</center><p>So when Eternal Sugar meets the gane, she was very kind and tended to everyone's injuries. She also spended a bit of time alone with Hollyberry, saying how she wishes Hollyberry to find her happiness and relax a bit from her responsibilities. With how kind Eternal Sugar is, it almost makes me forget she is a Beast and is very dangerous just like the other Beasts. Also with mentions of love in the story, are the romantic undertones between Hollyberry and Eternal Sugar intentional?? Like the cutscene and animations had them very close together, like Shadow Milk chapter is kinda gay, and Eternal Sugar is straight up gaymaxxing.</p><p>When the Hollyberrians decided to leave, Eternal Sugar doesn't mind very much, she instead let them go. All seems normal... until they got out and had a harder time fighting off the monsters outside. It feels as if the monsters are chasing after Hollyberry, she is having trouble fighting off all the monsters even with her strength. Wildberry jumps to protect Hollyberry from an attack, and suffered a very bad injury. Seeing her bodyguard sacrificing for her (and the fact she possibly see him as her adoptive son), she became extremely panicked, her team retreats into Eternal Sugar's land, asking for help once again.</p><p>Hollyberry searches for Eternal Sugar, thankfully she appeared in time, healing Wildberry's injuries. This time, Eternal Sugar looks into Hollyberry's heart deeper, saying how she has been burdening herself with expectations for a long time, and forgetting to care for herself. When Hollyberry became the Queen, she has to handle many responsibilities and tasks, and when Dark Flour War came, the duties became harder. She lost her dear friend Pure Vanilla from the war, the royalties became hostile towards one another, she slowly became more and more depressed. Even her son, Royalberry, worries for her wellbeing and alcoholism. Hollyberry eventually decided to move down from her throne and go on an adventure in Beast Yeast, only to hear the news about a dragon abducting one of her granddaughters away. Failing to protect her loved ones, she felt like a failure, her heart slowly building up walls away from love.</p><p>Eternal Sugar eventually reveals herself as one of the Beasts, to Hollyberry, it is quite a shock that the being who helped her is actually the villain. To Eternal Sugar, how unfair it is to call her one of the evil ones! All she did is trap her people in a land of eternal happiness, and when they want to leave, she leaves a sweet scent on them, attracting dangerous monsters to attack them, tricking them into believing staying in her land is the safest option... Yea she isn't as sweet as she looks, but hey she only wants her people to live in happiness for eternity, so all is good, right? And that's also what she did to Hollyberry, forcing her team to come back to her land, though Wildberry's injury is not intentional on her part.</p><p>At the end, Eternal Sugar asks Pavlova to break her shield, the arrow breaks it completely, her soul gem falling out. Eternal Sugar then traps her in her treasure box, perhaps symbolising how she treats the things she loves, the treasures she put there are safe, but they will never shine under the sunlight.</p><hr><h1>My thoughts</h1><h2>YURI!!!!</h2><p>You know, people have been shipping the beasts and the Ancients together, something something fated ones. Aside from Burning Spice and Golden Cheese (because Burning Spice only beat her up, no romantic worthy stuff), the Beast x Ancient ships are quite popular, especially Shadow Milk x Pure Vanilla. I don't care about this ship very much, particularly towards the most popular dynamic, as I prefer Shadow Milk being an annoying irredeemable thing instead of a sad lonely soft guy, but the fan content can be fun at times. However, I'm quite interested in how Eternal Sugar x Hollyberry develops, one is because Hollyberry is my fav, second is because from the trailer Eternal Sugar approaches Hollyberry under seemingly romantic lenses, as if Cookie Run writers learnt the art of queerbaiting. Eternal Sugar really just met Hollyberry and was like "I can fix her".</p><p>After I finished the first part of the story, do I still want to ship them together? I still think this ship has a lot of potential, even though Eternal Sugar is quite a red flag. She apparently have turned some of her people into statues for trying to leave, her most loyal companion, Pavlova, also expressed he wants to be free. But something in me doesn't want them to end up fighting and see each other as enemies like most of the Ancients did...</p><h2>Eternal Sugar: The most terrifying beast</h2><p>When the other Beasts met their Ancient counterparts, they are usually dangerous and threatening. Mystic Flour attempted to wipe off all of the cookie civilisation and ending the world, Burning Spice wanted to murder everything, Shadow Milk spreaded lies and could've caused war all over. The Ancients all suffered emotionally and/or physically, this just shows how ruthless these Beasts are. However, Eternal Sugar never showed herself to be evil at all, she showered Hollyberry's team with care, her land is colorful and sweet, they can't help but let their guard down. But it doesn't change the fact she manipulates the people into staying in her world, despite her kind mask, if they want to leave, they will suffer horrible consequences. While she hasn't done anything world-ending for the time being, I still find her to be the most terrifying Beast. Her actions are very toxic and manipulative, and yet it is very easy to miss this from the view of her people, she is so caring and kind, she only wants them to be safe, is she really evil? She mastered the art of manipulation so well, it is difficult to see past her disguise of sweetness.</p><p>Humans tend to have a hard time grasping large things, the size of the universe, the age of the Earth, the possibility of the world ending... And of course, when we read stories, we don't really feel the urgency when we are told their world is ending. And with the Beasts, yea sure they can thanos-snap away the world, or torture a person mentally into thinking their life is a lie, but we might not necessarily feel the dread the victims are feeling. However, in our world, many people might have fallen into the hands of manipulation, suffering from unimaginable pain. While I never experienced a tactic as bad as Eternal Sugar's, I still feel a sense of fear how good she is at putting up a guise.</p><h2>Family therapy when?</h2><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/if477bezgxvi4qqter1vc/dumbassme_20250508.webp?rlkey=qy7p4t1xmsdjc6u1u7dff1xt1&st=puq473d7&raw=1"><p>With this chapter, we finally get to dive deeper into her backstory. And like some predicted, or to some's surprise, Hollyberry, indeed, has a lot of unresolved trauma. Not only she has been carring the role of a protector her whole life, she also lost several loved ones. Unable to process her struggles, she became less energetic, and uses alcohol as a way to cope.</p><p>The most heartbreaking part of her backstory is perhaps her relationship with her son, Royalberry. While Hollyberry girmly ranted about the state of her kingdom after the Dark Flour War, Royalberry stood by her side, reminding her to drink less wine and say the people needs her. The scene isn't very long, but it says a lot about their relationship. Royalberry is said to be gentle and more frail, opposite to his mother's personality, and the reason becomes very apparent after that cutscene. Growing up during a vulnerable state in the kingdom, and the fact his mother got so depressed and alcoholic, instead of growing up in a healthy childhood, he has to be a caretaker of Hollyberry's wellbeing.</p><p>There's also the part where Hollyberry calls her son weak when several hunters talks about the sad state of Hollyberry Kingdom. Her words might not have been as harsh outside of English translation, but people still think it is awful for her to not defend her own son when people are talking trash about the new leaders. Some people mentioned that it is not because she didn't want to defend him, but because she can't. It is her that raised him to be this way, if she hadn't have fallen into depression back then, maybe Royalberry would've been more confident and strong...</p><p>So many people started to feel bad for Royalberry, despite having far less screen time than his wife, Jungleberry. Royalberry is similar to Dark Choco, who also has a neglectful parent, the only difference is Royalberry didn't crash out <s>Royalberry should crash out and slay his mother as a treat</s>. Some fans might have experienced having a kind, but neglectful parent as well, and felt extremely sympathic towards him. <a href="https://x.com/HD_OVENDOM/status/1920133796416061472" target="_blank">So there is this fan art of Hollyberry and Royalberry</a>, we see Royalberry's back, standing still while looking at Hollyberry, who lays on her throne wasted with her goblet still in her hand. Despite not being able to see his expression, we can certainly feel the emptiness and melancholy within his mind. Jesus Christ, this is the art I first saw on Twitter after I finished an exam, which I spent the free time thinking about how dark this new chapter is.</p><p>The official CRK Twitter account posted a Parent's Day art, Hollyberry, Princess and Jungleberry are there, but not Royalberry... Is this intentional on the artists part? Good god it hurts to badly.</p><p>A little light-hearted (or not) note, I see people putting Dark Choco, Royalberry and Rich Cheese (a scrapped character who is Golden Cheese's daughter, who probably also have parental issues from the concepts) together, the Ancients' neglected children. However, I think Matcha deserves to be part of the gang too, since she is technically Dark Enchantress' daughter, and Dark Enchantress is White Lily's other form. Poor Matcha, she just wants approval from her mom...</p><hr><p>Yea I did ask for angst for Hollyberry's new story, but I was expecting more like the pain and joy of watching a fav character whimpering pathetically on the floor, not a brutal dissection of how a dysfunctional family can affect one's childhood and mind! After reading through the story, there is a puddle of bitterness (funny this story is about a cookie made from sugar) in my stomach, it kinda feels like a therapist explaining a horrible truth without sugarcoating any of it. But in a way, I think the story is done very well, it explains a lot about Hollyberry's attitude, brings up her alcoholism, and makes Eternal Sugar an intimidating and interesting villain.</p><p>I can't wait for the next chapter, I hope at the end, Tiger Lily will be able to reunite with her family, and the family gets to have a therapy session!</p><p class="date">( 8 May 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
