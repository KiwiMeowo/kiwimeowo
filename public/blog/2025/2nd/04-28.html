I was worried if the game system is too complex and it will make me stressed out. I am also worried about the romance system, while I know it is entirely skippable, so many people enjoy the game because of the romance. And I'm afraid it is the only major reason people enjoy this game, and I will end up disappointed playing it. But there isn't any point worrying about a game I haven't played if all the mobile games I have are played to death, so I bought it.</p><hr><h2>Brief summary</h2><p>So I hit a roadblock upon the character creation menu. When I attempted to make the hair a lighter color, the hair always become very dull and grey. So I can't make characters like Cosmos, Lavender or even Kyrea! I can make my look in the game, but making an avatar that represents my real look is kind of boring, you know? So I made Jaspers instead, I will be playing as a male character.</p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/smbfjwplcaafzykdtigao/IMG_3713_20250428.jpg?rlkey=siw8rvf062qeiclpt26s1xh5n&st=11wfqr9r&raw=1"><center>Jaspers has a job and is miserable</center><p>Anyways, the story starts with grandpa dying and giving his a farm to take care of in case if the player gets sick of working under a big corporation. And after moving there, you can start farming, introducing yourself to villagers, and foraging. Eventually, you can also mine stuff, kill monsters, fish, and rebuild the community center.</p><hr><h2>My thoughts</h2><p>What I like about the game is that earning money isn't too difficult. When you plant a lot of crops and fish a lot, you definitely get money. I like it when I slowly learn how to make money, and see my daily income increase, like hell yea stonks.</p><p>But um, that's all I want to compliment now.</p><h2>Unfortunately</h2><p>As a person who likes to rush things and gets unintentionally competitive at times, I always want the game to progress rather quickly. However, this game is meant for us to take things slow and relax, which is so slow it created the opposite effect. While a chicken is the app icon for the game, it took me the whole spring to finish building a coop. And despite living in the town for a whole month, the people there still kinda see me as a stranger even though I talk to them semi-frequently (Also why can I only talk to them once daily). Because the relationship levels progress slowly, I couldn't invite anyone to dance with in the Flower Dance, and I just sits on the side watching other people, I was bitter as hell, why the hell should it be held in spring, which is may be the time player first started the game, when it is an event which requires high relationship level for players to participate????</p><p>Ok looking up Reddit, it seems the Flower Dance is meant to hurt the player some way, it is to encourage the players to build relationship with the characters, so that they can dance with a partner next year... <span class="emoji">🖕</span> God I play this game to relax, not to be more frustrated than I already am. It is quite realistic, but man it hurts a lot.</p><p>Ok back to less frustrating things, so in Stardew Valley, you have an energy bar that depletes every action you do. So if I go fishing for an afternoon, I will be left with no energy left. It isn't very bad, it's just that if I want to handle farming, mining and other stuff, it will be very difficult to handle them all. Also since there's limited time, it is hard to keep track of the villagers' daily routines, so far I managed to chat with Robin's family and Linus almost everyday, but it is hard to find them every single day, because you know, I have to do farmer duties.</p><p>It is getting overwhelming, and apparently some Stardew Valley players make a document on how they do every week, every season. Bro how is this cozy and relaxing? One thing I don't like to do for a game is planning, it is very stressful, I used to keep track of the clothing scores in Miracle Nikki, and I quickly got burnt out.</p><h2>ihateminingihateminingihateminingihateminingihateminingihateminingihatemining</h2><p>Is combatting meant to be cozy and relaxing? I just want to get some ores, but I also have to fight slimes, bugs, and flies?? Currently, I got stuck on level 10 because there is a swarm of cave flies and I can't fight them off.</p><p>I don't think I ever enjoyed fighting monsters in games. One intertesting fact about me is that I never beat survival mode in Minecraft, I only played in creative mode to build stuff. And whenever I start a survival world, I only got to the point of getting my first few diamonds, and I never got through of my fear of getting lost in caves and fighting off monster jumpscares. While there's no need to worry about getting lost in Stardew Valley's cave, the monsters are still a pain to beat up.</p><hr><p>I think the major reason I'm so frustrated with this game is because my high standards after seeing people's positive reviews. They all said it is relaxing, cozy and fun, but what I got is the opposite, and this morning I woke up very upset after playing it during the night. Maybe I should play it sometime later and give it another chance, but I should go study first or finish my OC ref, just to burn away my anger a bit...</p><center><h2>Rating: ★★☆☆☆</h2><br><p>Did I mention I hate mining?</p></center><p class="date">( 28 Apr 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
