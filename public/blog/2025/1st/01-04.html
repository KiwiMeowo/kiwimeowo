Upon closer inspection, it was a mosquito. Worst of all, I found another one hiding under the ceiling light cover (whatever it's called). Not wishing to be bitten during night time, I grabbed my bug spray, sprayed at the light (IDK if it's safe), turned off the lights, and went to the living room.</p><p>Majority of the human population hates mosquitoes, me included. They spread viruses, they make you itch, and most remarkably, they are REALLY annoying. Don't you hate it when you try to sleep or concentrate, they just fly past your ear like buzzzzzzz. And because they are so tiny, it is so hard to even kill one.</p><p>Mosquitoes seem to prefer biting me more than my sister, I might have got this from my father, who is also prone to mosquito attacks. I heard that having O-type blood makes you more popular to mosquitoes, but multiple articles I saw gave different answers.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Since blood type antigens can be found in the saliva and tears of secretors, it may be possible that mosquitoes can sense these antigens as they approach a person. However, there hasn’t been any research done to support this idea yet.</p></blockquote><figcaption><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mosquito-blood-type#research" target="_blank"><cite>Are Mosquitoes Attracted to Certain Blood Types?</cite>, Healthline</a></figcaption></figure><hr><figure><blockquote><p>Mosquitoes have no preference for a specific blood type.</p></blockquote><figcaption><a href="https://en.chinacdc.cn/in_focus/202306/t20230602_266496.html" target="_blank"><cite>Are people with Type O blood more attractive to mosquitoes?</cite>, chinacdc.cn</a></figcaption></figure><hr><figure><blockquote><p>In a study published in the American Journal of Entomology in 2019, researchers conducted an experiment in which mosquitoes were given the option to feed on A, B, AB, and O blood types. The mosquitoes chose the Type O feeder more than any other.</p></blockquote><figcaption><a href="https://ourbloodinstitute.org/blood-matters/mosquitoes-blood-type/" target="_blank"><cite>Yes, Mosquitoes Can Tell Your Blood Type</cite>, Our Blood Institute</a></figcaption></figure><hr><p>Perhaps it is an observation that isn't studied very much? But whatever the case, my body is just attractive to mosquitoes, that's something undeniable.</p><hr><p>Back to my recent life, mosquitoes also went into my room life a few weeks ago. Whilst I was sleeping, I heard a faint buzzing noise. Having built to fear this noise, I turned on the lights immediately to find the sneaky culprit. With my sensitive eyes (Though near-sighted, I notice tiny movements well), I saw a tiny black dot floating above my bed. I decided to fling my blanket at that spot, hoping to kill it somehow... And it worked? I saw on the floor is the remains of that mosquito, well that was easy. I went back to bed.</p><p>...</p><p>Oh god damn it there's another one. But this time, I couldn't find the mosquito. Frustrated and tired, I decided to sleep in another room. This was always the strategy of mine to avoid mosquitoes. I would move to the living room or computer room to sleep in the scenario that my room isn't safe or comfortable enough to sleep anymore, even if I have to sleep on the sofa or even on the floor.</p><p>But that night wasn't an easy one, there's another one, and another one... I kept moving rooms, thinking if the mosquitoes followed me as I left the rooms. At some point though, mosquitoes stopped following me, but that was like 3 in the morning, they have successfully disrupted my sleep schedule. I woke up quite exhausted.</p><p>I should invest in things that stop mosquitoes from entering, but man aren't they tough to deal with.</p><p class="date">( 4 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
