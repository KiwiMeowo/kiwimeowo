I wish I can fly also, travelling would be a lot easier if humans can fly like birds, though I think humans would have to invent some sort of traffic system to not have flying humans bump into each other, which would be annoying. Perhaps if I have a wish to be granted, maybe I'll just keep the power to myself :3</p><p>Oh to feel the wind flowing onto my face, and travel from one place to another without having to walk for an hour, this sounds like a wonderful experience (ignoring my fear of heights). I don't remember if I daydream a lot about flying when I was young, but I'm sure my passion for flying reignited when I played Sky: Children of the Light. It is a game about flying and making friends, but the flying mechanic is so satisfying and fun. When you run and boost yourself in the perfect angle, your flying speed will go fast, it's like a dopamine boost everytime you fly, it feels so good it gave me inspiration for art and even created Cosmos (how many times I have mentioned this fact?).</p><p>I often fly in my dreams, but the amount of it increased a lot after playing Sky. I flew to buildings near my home, around the popular buildings in Hong Kong, inside shopping malls and more. There is one time that I outright became Cosmos in my dreams, going on an adventure and saving some random people. The dreams where I get to fly tend to be the most fun ones, I wish I get to fly more.</p><p>Realistically, we might never be able to fly, unless if you believe we turn into ghosts that can fly after we die. While I'm not the type to believe in afterlife, or I understand if ghosts become earth-bound or suffer from some limitations, I sometimes wish I can fly and travel around the world after I die. One thing I want to do is to fly to a mountain near my home, and check if it is covered by grass or trees (Something I have discussed with a friend during secondary school). Then I would just lay down on the mountain, feeling the breeze and quietness while enjoying the view of the city I once lived in.</p><p>I also want to take that opportunity to explore the corners of the world where I didn't get to see. Maybe I can go to my old primary school and look behind all the locked doors, or go to overseas restaurants and eat the food (Can ghosts eat food that are not offerings?), or maybe go to Devsister's building and look at all the scrapped/hidden art of the characters, especially Pomegranate Cookie, I wanna know more of her past.</p><p>Also I wonder, if ghosts can go beyond the Earth, I want to try going to space. Not too far that I'd get lost forever, but maybe just to the distance of the Moon. Space horrifies me, but also fascinates me, because of how gigantic it is, makes me become lost in the wonder of how it is even possible. Maybe I would sit on the Moon, looking at the tiny, blue planet, where all the human population lives in...</p><p>It's night time as I'm writing this, hope I will have a nice dream. Good night!</p><p class="date">( 11 Jan 2025 )</p><hr></div></article><div id="c_widget"></div><script src="/comment-widget.js"></script></section></main><script src="/spoiler.js"></script></body></html>
