            <div class="inner">
                <p>Cookie Run is a series of mobile games made by Devsisters, a Korean game company. Like the name suggests, the theme is running cookies. While the game contains plenty of stories, it often focuses on the protagonist, Gingerbrave, who escapes from the oven and the witch, and meets up various other cookies and goes on an adventure.</p>
                <p>The first version of Cookie Run, Ovenbreak (2009) has a vastly different artstyle, though the theme of cookies and witches, and the gameplay is still there. This is also where Dozer (A cookie not present in any games but Witch's Castle) made his first appearance, but he presummedly got eaten by the witch.</p>
                <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c8646mgg3doz33scwxve8/OvenBreak1_20250524.webp?rlkey=5ols0l1uqiwlayoac262kzytu&raw=1" loading="lazy">
                <p>In 2011, Ovenbreak 2 was released, with more playable cookies, such as GingerBright, GingerBerry (Currently known as Strawberry Cookie), NinjaBread (Current known as Ninja Cookie), and more. It's also where pets are first implemented.</p>
                <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/z6ygyhwkydkhb841f5wfk/Ovenbreak2_20250524.jpeg?rlkey=tzuqsna9jaisi1kmgz8mdcrqi&raw=1" loading="lazy">
                <p>Eventually, Cookie Run for Line, Kakao and QQ was released (2014). In this game, plenty of new content and lore was added. Plenty of cookies are added (such as Moonlight Cookie, Tiger Lily Cookie, Peach Cookie etc.), and they have different ranks (rarities). It establishes several worldbuilding stuff, including Dragon's Valley, Dessert Paradise, Cookie Kingdom (A.K.A. Hollyberry Kingdom currently) and City of Wizards.</p>

                <p>In 2016, Cookie Run Ovenbreak was released (My first CR game). Not only does it have plenty of game modes and monthly updates, it also releases entertaining stories frequently, they are either slice-of-life stories, or lore heavy stuff that build the worldbuilding and the personalities of the cookies. The mainline stories include Cookies of Darkness, Time Balance Department, the Dragons, the Nova Cookies and more.</p>

                <p>In 2021, Cookie Run Kingdom is released, which is perhaps the one you are most familiar with. Instead of the usual runner gameplay, this game focuses on kingdom building and RPG-style gaming. The story mainly focuses on the Ancients, the Cookies of Darkness and the Beasts.</p>

            <div class="inner">
                <p>If I gathered all the people I knew online, I believe most of them would know me as the one who likes Pomegranate Cookie very much. And one thing I felt strange while making this site is that I don't talk much about Cookie Run here, even though it has been part of me for like 6 years. So, I will write down all the memorable things here, like it deserves.</p>
<hr>
<h2 data-border="Beginning"><span>Beginning</span></h2>
<p>Cookie Run posts had appeared in my Facebook timeline far before I have played it, it is a game quite popular in its Line era. People would make pretty fanart for the cookies, and when I see what they actually look like in game, I was like "Huh??? People like these guys???". It took me a few more years to actually gain interest in this game.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2018, I was scrolling Facebook like always, when I stumbled onto a video named <a href="https://youtu.be/JW1Hjd8Y2vE?si=7cBp_OncklCmQleG" target="_blank">Herbal Tylenol</a>. The ridiculousness of the video is what made me intrigued about this game, fandoms making dumb memes like these often means there are plenty of great content there. And after that, on 3 Sep 2019, I decided to download the game to see what's up.</p>
<hr>
<p>My first impressions of the game is that the characters are all very charming. I really like how diverse the designs are, and that there's a small (or big) story behind them. My first favourite character is Avocado Cookie, my main for trophy race, because she had the highest health among my cookies (I did not have the idea of metas yet). Her puns in the loading screen caught me off guard as I bursted into laughter.Despite Avocado's physique and looks, I was surprised to learn she's in fact female, and that got me questioning my sexuality. Kiwi please you always have the trend of liking female characters more.</p>
<p>Fun fact: I joined this game the same day as Squid Ink Cookie's release. And the next update after Squid is the Millennial Tree update, which Pomegranate Cookie is released first. My first impressions of this cookie is that I find the design cute, but nothing much else. It took me two more updates to start liking Pome, which is the 2nd anniversery update, where the affection system is first released. I was poking around the cookies to see their dialogues, and my heart absolutely melted when I saw Pome tilting her head and winking, SHE'S SO CUTEEE</p>
<img src="/fixiations/deco/pomewink.png" alt="Pomegranate Cookie from Cookie Run" title="LIKE LOOK AT HER!!!!">
<p>That sprite is probably more like a look of disgust considering that's her unhappy sprite, but man this is the sprite that got me liking her. So after that, I started to look for all the fanart of Pome, and even drew her so many times. I kept waiting any smallest crumbs of content about her, though it takes forever for her to even appear a bit in events. I remember being excited about her gems appearing in the Moonlight Candy release story event, implying she sealed Moonlight away and caused Moonlight to be split in half.</p>
<hr>
<h2 data-border="Community and friends"><span>Community and friends</span></h2>
<p>Although I am from Hong Kong, majority of the people I friended on Facebook are Taiwanese, I'm still able to connect with them as we all write in Chinese. And in the first Grand Champions League (GCL), I was rooting for 世文, the Taiwanese player who made it to the final round. I found his videos before this event, when I saw him restarting a run because of the smallest mistake (sometimes I don't even know what the mistake is). I was quite surprised, not knowing competitive players would create insane strategies to get high scores, including jumping into holes to get more distance, or using the jump treasure to go further (Before a certain update, you can use the jump treasure to extend the health because even if you run out of health, as long as you have jumps left, you can go even further mid air).</p>
<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cfpssfzje0vazoe5g2zhb/ovenbreak_20250321.gif?rlkey=xb2ch1qfaj6e6ynbk3qbti47r&st=g3x7m8h5&raw=1">
<p>Back to the topic of GCL, I was so excited about his streams, I never thought I would be this hyped watching a gaming competition, and I always got so happy when I see that he passed another round. He did not become the champion of this season, however, he got the respect from many players. It was this event that made me and many players interested in Guilds, where players can gather together and fight. Lucky, very soon Devsister (the company that made this game) will grant us this wish...</p>
<hr>
<p>In the update of Milk and Yam, the guild system is released. At that time, I already joined a Discord server to talk about this game <span style="font-size: 0.66em;">and the leaks</span>. When the server released the guild branches, I entered one of them. To my surprise, the owner of my guild is actually Taiwanese, I found that out when he posted in a Chinese Facebook group I was in. There's a lot of fun times during these times, while I don't chat as much in the server now, me and the long-time guild members still have a nice relationship.</p>
<p>Sometime in November 2019, the official Cookie Run Ovenbreak Discord server is made. I mainly chatted in funtalk and storybook, but when the mods removed the off topic channel, the off topic people moved to funtalk, and I'm just gonna say that they don't match my vibes. Anyways, I like talking about the deeper lores of Cookie Run, like how Millennial Tree likely won't stop tragedies from happening in order to keep the timeline stable (which makes him an interesting character), the untold backstory of Pome, and how awesome Timekeeper is. Who doesn't love the yellow orbular omni-potent god?</p>
<p>On the topic of Timekeeper, because of storybooker's love of Timekeeper, we actually got closer and frequently chat with each other now. I feel like these group of people is 90% of my daily social interaction, it feels so great to have somebody to listen to my ramblings, like Pome, my OCs <s>and hot muscular characters</s>. It's amazing how a game can bring people together.</p>
<hr>
<h2 data-border="Ballkeeper"><span>Ballkeeper</span></h2>
<p>Let's take the time to appreciate Timekeeper. I got extremely invested in this story because of the theory of Croissant and Timekeeper being the same cookie from different timelines (which has been confirmed). So many people were talking about it, with many fanarts exploring their dynamic and imaginations of Croissant taking on the role of the director. When the reveal happened, I was so ecstatic, we already called it, but it's still unbelievable. They have very drastic personalities, and yet they are actually the same cookie, like what happened to this version of Croissant that made her into an insane time god? </p>
<p>Looking back, I think this update is my all-time favourite update in CROB, the story is amazing, and I love the personalities of Croissant, Timekeeper and other members of the TBD.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Croissant is an ambitious engineer who cares a lot about her collegues</li>
    <li>Timekeeper is a silly god who likes to cause trouble just because she can</li>
    <li>String Gummy is a depressed guy (squeezes him)</li>
    <li>Coffee Candy may have fallen asleep on her first day of her job, but she's still competent in her position and I won't let the haters change my mind</li>
    <li>Baguette may seem strict, but she's more caring than she looks</li>
    <li>Schneeball is so ambitious she wants to trap her manager in a relic</li>
    <li>Marble Bread just wants to get his job done and relax, honestly mood</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more background characters in TBD, but even after the third TBD update, the writers still haven't do this storyline dirty, which is quite a miracle. While some may think TBD is overrated, I still think it is such an interesting and fun story, I can't wait for more content for it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 data-border="A birth of a new Kingdom"><span>A birth of a new Kingdom</span></h2>
<p>Two years after teasing a kingdom-building game, they finally released the pre-release trailers for Cookie Run: Kingdom. Not only there's brand new gameplay, there was even more characters and storylines. The part I was the most excited about is the appearance of Pomegranate Cookie in the animated trailer, like OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD SHES HERE. And the fact cookies now have voices after years of them just having squeaky sound effects? Fantastic.</p>
<p>What I also excited about are the Ancients, a group of five cookies that are the main plotlines of CRK. I thoroughly looked over their bios and designs, noticing that Pure Vanilla and White Lily has appeared in Roguefort's skill background, and Hollyberry and Dark Cacao are the emperors of the kingdoms mentioned in the original CR games. Golden Cheese was completely new, I was quite surprised to learn she's female considering her outfit. Analysing these characters so deeply made me get attached to them, I'm a sucker for big figures in a small team, where I can headcanon them as silly friends.</p>
<p>If I have to talk about the stories, it will take me a long time to explain them all, because so many of them are so good, like the twist that White Lily is Dark Enchantress, Cotton and Sherbet's story, and the part when Pome pyschologically tortured Dark Choco, go girlboss go. My most favourite ones are the Cremé Republic story where the three of the Ancients get to hang out and let their personalities shine, and also the Golden Cheese arc, which I have already mentioned in my past blog in 2023 (GOLDEN CHEESE MY QUEENNNNN). </p>
<p>Time passed so much ever since the release of CRK, so much that all the Ancients has been released, and the story of the Beasts are currently being released one by one. If I have to mention a Beast story I particularly liked at the moment, I like Burning Spice and Golden Cheese arc, where Golden Cheese and Smoked Cheese fucking roasts Burning Spice in front of his most loyal minion Nutmeg Tiger. Actually do the CRK writers likes Golden Cheese the most? Her character writing is always so good!</p>
<p>Currently, I already stopped play CROB as it was too time-consuming, and my passion for CR is slowly draining, I mostly still play CRK because I have a guild to take care of. I'm still very interested in the storyline though, I wanna learn about Pome's story and how Hollyberry would fall under Eternal Sugar's hands. While Devsisters often has questionable decisions (Fans sometimes hate certain updates so much they bring out a truck to protest in front of their building), I'm not going to deny CR's art and stories are charming.</p>
<hr>
<h2 data-border="How it changed me"><span>How it changed me</span></h2>
<p>Cookie Run is a media that I stayed fixiated the longest. In the past, I only stay in a fandom for 1-2 years, but for Cookie Run, I stayed for 6 years (or even longer). So, does it have any influence in me? It was a bit hard to notice, but chances are certainly there, especially in terms of art.</p>
<p>I can point out similarities between CR and my OC stories. One of which is the silly friend group thing mentioned while discussing the Ancients. Seeing this characters makes me realise how fun it is to watch characters in serious positions doing silly stuff. And thus, it influenced me to create the RS, they aren't as important as the Ancients, but they are still very close with the members.</p>
<p>Another thing is the magic system. While I'm always a fan of magical world building, playing Cookie Run has made me realise the potential of magic, especially time magic. My W.I.P. OC story Dreamland Workshop is actually inspired by TBD, the workshop works primarily on Chronos Magic. I also thought about other powerful but dangerous magic elements, such as Space Magic (alters the physical world structure) and Soul Magic (Manipulates life and mind). Knowing how dangerous time magic is in the world of CR, I feel like these three magic elements I added is quite worth exploring, maybe they can cause some fucked up fates for characters.</p>
<p>Pretty sure Cookie Run is the media which made me start enjoying muscular women. Avocado Cookie might just be a tiny cookie, but her build is definitely muscular, same goes with Hollyberry. Never though I'd actually enjoy muscular characters, but here we are. If it weren't the fact I played Cookie Run, I probably would not have made Cosmos this way.</p>
<p>There's also the thing where my artstyle becoming more chibi for a few years because of Cookie Run, but it isn't worth talking about much.</p>
