            <h1>Sky: Children of the Light</h1>
            <div class="inner min">
                <p>Sky: COTL is an open world game developed by ThatGameCompany, the style is quite similar to Journey (which I haven't played at the time I'm playing this). It is a game where you play as a child with a cape, and they can fly using their cape like wings. The objective of the game is light up the spirits you encounter, gather glowing children, which will give you more wing energy capacity, and reach the end of the map.</p>
                <hr>
             <p>On 2020 Jan, I noticed my sister is playing an open-world-like game, seeing my sister getting lost in a seemingly huge map has got my interest. And what's more interesting in my opinion is that there's black avatars roaming around, and apparently those are real players! I asked for the game name and started playing.</p>
            <p>I don't exactly recall the string of events, but I remember someone friended me when I was in Prairie, and started taking me to collect spirits and winged light, I named them Bob. I appreciate the help, but at the time I felt like cheating because the portals indicate I'm not supposed to be there yet. When we entered the 8-player room, I decided to leave the player by waving bye bye.</p>
            <p>I think the stuff happened quite normally during the start to valley, I explored every corner I can think of, collect stuff, try out new emotes and click on stuff... And on one of the tips, it says "beware of dark creatures" with an image of the dark dragon (AKA Krill) showing. I was already lowkey paranoid about losing wings in the rain, what the fuck you mean there's enemies?</p>
            <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t0ixnukaotjt171ldi7d8/IMG_2565.png?rlkey=tmy0a9rvwqnut8n9phmdw8d6r&amp;st=q918gykq&amp;raw=1">
            <center>Wtf</center>
            <p>I should mention the Valley Elders cutscene, which is one of my favs. The Valley Elder Twins are so cool and tall, you'd assume they have a intimidating and cool aura. But quickly, they started fighting over the light my skykid was holding, and they played some sort of badminton game with the light as a ball, eventually they yeeted it into the sky... They quickly became my fav by how silly they are acting, classic sibling behavior.</p>
            <p>As I reached Wasteland, I noticed the atmosphere becoming more unnerving and creepy, oh no is this the place? In there's I encountered crabs for the first time, I actually thought they were frogs at first, anyway I was so shocked when I learnt they can attack me. I got freaked out and left the area. In the next room, I saw the krill for the first time, I was so amazed by this creature, I took a screenshot with it. As I got closer, the krill shone red light on me, I got scared and hid away, knowing the red light definitely means bad news. After I scurriedly moved to the next area, what shocked me is EVEN MORE KRILLS. I got so anxious navigating the area, I rammed myself into a corner and quit the game.</p>
            <p>A few days later, I gathered courage again to play again and travel this horrible area again. But this time, I managed to find two friends, they are moths (Newbies) just like me! I named one Peter and other one Mary. We held hands and got through Wasteland together, still scared but less scared.</p>
            <p>We got to the next map: Vault. I really love the atmosphere there, it reminds me of the theatre near home. It is a place usually for performances and dance classes. My sister used to do ballet, I actually tried too when I was a wee little girl, but my mom didn't let me continue because she's afraid of me growing even taller (That didn't stop me from growing anyway). However, I was often brought there to wait for my sister and pick her up. I spent a lot of time roaming around there, there's a mini garden that I thought there are pandas because there's bamboos, quiet corridors, the vending machine that I often mess with, and the subtle piano music playing somewhere. It was very peaceful, I should visit there again sometime, but am I allowed to enter the corridor? (And my original concept for Lavender is that her vibes to similar to the theatre, quiet, mysterious but kinda calming)</p>
            <p>Ah I strayed too far from the topic. Nothing much happens in Vault, it's just us worrying if we would fall from the elevator and be separated (It won't happen, we will float along the elevator). It was very beautiful when we ride the manta and got to the top floor, the music also gets louder and beautiful. And here comes my other fav Elder cutscene, it starts by Vault Elder gently asking for my skykid to come closer, their mask and movements gave me the vibes that they have gone through a lot of things, I felt a sense of sadness. My skykid handed over the light to the lantern thing Vault Elder's holding. As it floats into the air, it illuminates the rurals, showing the Elders and the citizens past. The cutscenes ends with all the Elders showing behind Vault elder, slowly bowing down to my skykid, wishing for the success of the next mission... I like Vault Elder, I sometimes call them Vault Mom (gender neutral), I enjoy going out of bounds just to chill next to Vault Elder for a while.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2><i>That part</i></h2>
            <p><span class="spoiler">After the cutscene, my skykid is in a room with the broken elevator, and a mysterious gate in front of them. The room is dark, with thunders echoing in the room. As my team entered the gate, we knew this mission will be tough...</span></p>
            <p><span class="spoiler">We were in Eden, a place so windy it is hard to walk properly, the atmosphere was so tense. With the doors opening, warning showed, "Beyond this door, the Light awaits. By entering, you risk losing all winged lights". This sounds serious, but we have gone so far, and nothing is stopping us, and also I was bold enough to think I am skillful enough to not lose any lights lol. And what immediately followed, is being smacked in the face by rocks. We couldn't really process what exactly happened, then we lost some of our winged light. It took us a lot of trial and error to finally get past those flying rocks, but that isn't even the end.</span></p>
            <p><span class="spoiler">The next area is a krill patrolling the area, and we have to time and hide correctly in order to avoid being krilled. However, we don't know much about its pattern, so we got krilled multiple times. It was quite discouraging, having lost so many of my winged light I worked so hard for. And some how, we got through that too, and the next area with both flying rocks and krill. After that is a corridor with lot's of winged light, a calm before the storm. A message shows just before entering the final area of Eden, that beyond this is a point of no return, I foolishly thought we can get through this unscathed...</span></p>
            <p><span class="spoiler">The final area is a place with hailing red stones, getting hit by one can eat up all your energy and take your winged lights. We were bruised and hurt, but we tried to get through, just like we did before. We noticed buttons appear when we get near the statues, but we don't know what it did (It's actually to give the statue your winged light). The hailing rocks seemed to never stop after a certain point, and yet we knew nothing but to move forward.</span></p>
            <p><span class="spoiler">I finally understood what "risk losing all winged lights" mean, despite my confidence, I was very wrong about myself. "Well, this has to me a planned lose scene... right?" is what I thought to myself, I watched my friends and me slowly lose every winged light, slowly meeting our demise...</span></p>
            <p><span class="spoiler">I found my skykid slowly falling in a dark room, as I landed, I walked in the direction of a small light. A white skykid sits on the around, my skykid offers them a hand, getting them up. I clicked on the white skykid, there's one option: To hug them. As the two embraced each other, a strong light appeared... My skykid suddenly gained back their wings! YEAHHH I'M ALIVE AGAIN! I flew up, like I always do.</span></p>
            <p><span class="spoiler">As I entered a new area, I was excited to see that Peter and Mary are there too. Together we flew through the strange building, with mantas, jellyfish and a whale (?!). The music I'm listening rn is the ost playing in this area, and as I was going through this beautiful area with my new friends, we flew above the broken building, noticing the top has the elder statues in the top layer of the vault area, and the camera zooms out to show a large castle-like structure. The climax of the music plays like perfect synchronisation, it brought me so much chills to my bones, god how was I not crying at this part?</span></p>
            <p><span class="spoiler">We were in space, with the spirits we collected along the journey flying with us. With AURORA's singing, the flight with our friends feels so amazing, like we have accomplished something great.</span></p>
            <p><span class="spoiler">Finally, we landed in a larger area, it's so big, but we weren't very sure what we were supposed to do. We just see there's a giant gate waiting for us, so we just went there. We slowly walked into the giant gate, light slowly covers the screen, letting us come back to life once again...</span></p>
            <p><span class="spoiler">After the credits, I was dropped back to home. Peter and Mary was nowhere to be found (they actually never returned D:), but I was quite amazed by the story, I didn't really know how to react. The story may have ended, but what if I kept playing? So on my own, I started exploring more deeply in each areas, well not Eden yet, it kinda traumatised me.</span></p>
            <p>After learning a bit more about the game, I learnt you collect candles and trade hearts, then you can use these two to buy cosmetics. The first one I bought is the big twin tails, as a past twin tails enjoyer, I really appreciate the game giving so much cuteness to this hairstyle. The next cosmetic I bought is the teal cape, because among all colors, I feel like it looks the best. After that, I got the umbrella as my main equipment, it is helpful in Forest (which is rainy and can exhaust you quickly), and also it looks kinda like a sword and looks cool. And my main clothing was from the Season of Rhythm, idk it looks cool. Later on, I got the cape from the Crab Whisperer, I was very fond of the style and colors, it really matches my skykid's vibes. I skipped some of the minor parts, but here's what my skykid look like!</p>
            <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dbybmg27a0va7aqaun9zd/IMG_2566.jpg?rlkey=kuagttmx7uelnq9n8nvin5z1g&amp;st=azh4teea&amp;raw=1">
            <p>If you remember, Cosmos' design is inspired my skykid, it's the very reason why Cosmos has a deep blue, teal and yellow color scheme, and why she used to have twin tails! Her personality is also influenced by my skykid's (at least that's what I think my skykid's personality is), I enjoy flying and racing a lot when playing Sky, I also enjoy dancing emotes the most, so much so one of my Sky friends named me BEATS (The chat was bugged and they couldn't see my messages). I should really name my skykid, how about Cerulean?</p>
            <p>I should also mention one of my fav seasons is the Season of Dreams, where the last event is dancing with the child whose aspiration is to perform in the stage. The child wears red, while I wear blue, it feels like a perfect combination in this performance. I feel like a star dancing in the ice ring, and I must say I was devastated when the child and the other spirits ascended to the sky, reminding me that these people are deceased. My other fav is Season of Aurora, the concert is so wonderful, it brought me back the feelings I first had playing Sky. It also showed the Two Shield War, which fans have been speculating for ages.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Lore and story aside, what amazed me is also the people I found. Whenever you are in trouble, like losing all your lights or getting lost, someone might come up to you and offer to help. I made a couple of friends while I was being helped or I was helping them. And after experiencing the final area, I was quite traumatised, but I knew that other moths might feel the same too. So whenever I visit that area again, I often check for other players in trouble, and help them out. I feel proud knowing some of the moths I helped grew and learn things to be a veteran.</p>
            <p>Secondly, people can come up with interactions just using the emotes. When you light someone's candles, or help someone, the players will bow down to you. The first time I saw this, I decided to get the bow emote, and I started using it like how other people use it. There are no rules saying you should bow to other players, and yet players somehow came up with this culture, allowing manners to be part of the game, I always felt it is so funny and amazing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I sometimes can't imagine how nice players can be. For multiple seasons, I received seasonal packages from some of my Sky friends. These things costs money, and you just give them to me? Someone whose face you never even saw?? I still remember spending hours chatting and hanging out with them, it is quite a surreal experience. While I don't enter the game as often, I'm still in their Discord server.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I really recommend you to at least get to the ending playing this game, the art, story and gameplay are just wonderful. If you want to play long-term, it can be a bit grindy, but the cosmetics are quite nice, you can even play the piano when you buy it. Also you might get to meet some nice people. Perhaps maybe it will change your life a bit, just like me!</p>
