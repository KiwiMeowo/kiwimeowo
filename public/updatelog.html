        <p>Always felt like the mobile interface is a bit awkward, you have to scroll down the navbar and the list of webrings to get to the main part. So, I rearranged the sections so that the main section shows at the top in mobile! Since it would be weird for the navbars to not be at the top, the quick navbar is visible on mobile (this also applied to blog page)!</p>
        <p>Also, I edited the directory of many images to the proper files, I hope I didn't break anything lmao</p>

        <p>Blog page is now iframe-less using fetch(), but I have to do so much mental gymnastics because it always fucks up the javascript, god I don't want to feel this again.

I wanted to do something similar, but you can see simple and small moments between my OCs every refresh or clicking the refresh button.
