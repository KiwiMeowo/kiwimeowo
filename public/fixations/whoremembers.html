        <div class="inner">
          <p>This is a compliation of the most memorable moments in my fixations, mostly Cookie Run. And obviously, this contains <b>spoilers</b> (Most of these spoilers are like years old though), so proceed with warning!</p>

                <img src="deco/CR/PomeConceptArt.jpg" alt="Pomegranate's concept Art">
                <p>I don't know why so little people are talking about this, but Pome's concept art got revealed recently (like 30 Jan 2026). It seems she weren't specified as a Cookie of Darkness when she was first created, and she seems to be quite caring towards children, which is still true til this day (unless said child is against DE). Her eyes also looked goofy, thousand mile stare.</p>

            <img src="deco/CR/TimeKeeper.webp" alt="TimeKeeper Twist">
            <p>Time travelling is such a cool concept to be added into the Cookie Run worldbuilding, and having two characters technically being the same person is awesome as hell. Before the reveal, some people had already predicted that Croissant and Time Keeper are the same cookie by observing their similarities in their design. When watching this scene, I didn't lose the excitement by predicting the twist beforehand, but my excitement was enhanced!</p>

            <img src="deco/CR/DE.webp" alt="Dark Enchantress Twist">
            <p>For many years, the background of Dark Enchantress remained a mystery, we only knew she's a villain, and wants to engulf the cookie world in darkness or whatever. To make her turn out to be one of the heroes who built a kingdom is actually a fantastic lore twist and lore expansion. It really gives us a new perspective for this character, honestly it's way better than just standing there intimidatingly in your cookie inventory.</p>

            <img src="deco/CR/PureLily.webp" alt="Pure Vanilla having feelings for Lily">
            <p>Did I say I hate romance subplots? Yes. Did I love this scene? Also yes. I didn't expect them to make Pure Vanilla actually romantically like White Lily, like they could've pretended they are just regular friends. I do enjoy PureLily, but the reason I like this scene is mostly I find the hardcore shippers screaming funny, also I also find it funny to watch really strange cookie love triangle.</p>

            <img src="deco/CR/PomeGay.webp" alt="Pome bridal carrying Dark Enchantress">
            <p>There isn't much lore twist going on, I just love how Pome holds Dark Enchantress so lovingly. Cookie Run artists didn't have to add this cutscene, yet they did. Pome is so gay.</p>

            <p>Despite Eternal Sugar being an over-protective and abusive Beast, Hollyberry still protected Eternal Sugar from her crumbling world. I really love how in love Eternal Sugar is in this picture, but really, who doesn't act like that when a strong, pretty woman shields you like that?</p>
