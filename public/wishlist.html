        <p>Hello, if you want ideas drawing my OCs, you can check out this wishlist. I tend to get nervous looking at wishlists because I feel like I am not meeting their expectations when I am not doing that, so I decided to save it in a seperate page!</p>

        <h2>Character interactions</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Shipping with Jaspers/Claire, Solar/Claire, Solar/Jaspers (even though Solar see him as a rival)</li>
        <li>Cosmos hanging out with Lavender, maybe learning about magic or having a chill time watching a pretty view</li>
        <li>Honestly I love seeing Lavender/Cosmos/Grey/Ruth or Jaspers/Claire/Solar/Grey interacting, if you feel like it, maybe you can try other combinations!</li>
        <li><a href="oc/story/The_Ultimate_Game_of_Cards.html">Lavender/Cosmos/Grey/Ruth playing UNO</a></li>
        <li>Lavender/Mira angst.... or fluff, fluff is good too, draw them cuddling or something cute</li>
        <li>WAIT but I wanna see Cosmos and Lavender cuddling too :((</li>
        <li>Actually make Solar, Jaspers and Claire cuddle on a sofa while they watch TV or something, sorry I like cuddling too much.</li>
        <li>Jaspers, Claire, Solar and Grey (pick any number of these) in a karaoke session</li>
      </ul>
