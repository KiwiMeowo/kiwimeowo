        <p>Hello, if you want ideas drawing my OCs, you can check out this wishlist. I tend to get nervous looking at wishlists because I feel like I am not meeting their expectations when I am not doing that, so I decided to save it in a seperate page!</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Character interactions</h2>
        <p>- Shipping with Jaspers/Claire, Solar/Claire, Solar/Jaspers (even though Solar see him as a rival)</p>
        <p>- Cosmos hanging out with Lavender, maybe learning about magic or having a chill time watching a pretty view</p>
        <p>- Honestly I love seeing Lavender/Cosmos/Grey/Ruth or Jaspers/Claire/Solar/Grey interacting, if you feel like it, maybe you can try other combinations!</p>
        <p>- Lavender/Mira angst.... or fluff, fluff is good too, draw them cuddling or something cute</p>
        <p>- WAIT but I wanna see Cosmos and Lavender cuddling too :((</p>
        <p>- Jaspers, Claire, Solar and Grey (pick any number of these) in a karaoke session</p>
        <p>- If you want to draw ship art, maybe these songs can help you get their dynamic better:</p>
        <ul>
        <p>- Lavender & Mira: <a href="https://youtu.be/gEhuGPXxRrA" target="_blank">The Crane Wives - Curses</a></p>
        <p>- Jaspers to Claire: <a href="https://youtu.be/oOlWu15vzyE?si=uCAG2Aoq2k7_qlt4" target="_blank">Mili - Past the Stargazing Season (Cover)</a></p>
        <p></p>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>- Give my characters other clothing, especially Jaspers, he is bare-chested he's gonna get a cold</p>
        <p>- Ruth in a magical girl outfit, she loves magical girls</p>
        <p>- Mira getting into weirdly comedic accidents and somehow come out unharmed like while making a silly expression like the clumsy anime girl (Like being hit by a truck and not dying)</p>
        <p>- Draw them in Cookie Run style!</p>
        <p>- Memes are absolutely welcome</p>
        <p>- OC art inspired by song lyrics, particularly The Crane Wives or Will Wood</p>
        <p>- Kyrea playing Minecraft</p>
        <p>- Cosmos</p>
