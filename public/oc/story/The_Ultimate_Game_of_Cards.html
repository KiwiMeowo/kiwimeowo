RED 7! I bet you don’t have a red card!”</p><p>The ever-quiet wizard spoke up, “It’s true I do not have a red card…” Showering in victory (in Cosmos’ head), the cat-woman anticipated for Lavender to draw a card, as she pulled Lavender away from the winner’s throne-</p><p>“Blue 7.” Lavender placed down a card on the collpased card stack.</p><p>The rest of the group laughed and applauded at the final victory of Lavender, while Cosmos stood by the table, dumbfounded. Ruth broke into laughter as she tried to catch her breath, “Hahahaha! That was a great game, Lavender!”.</p><p>Lavender haven’t took part in group activities for so long, especially not a card game like this. However, it seems being with people isn’t as daunting as she imagined.</p><p>“We still have time for one more game, do you guys want to continue?” Grey collected the cards on the table, stacking them back all together. “I wanna!” Ruth exclaimed. “I will win this time!” Wolf swiftly grabbed a new set of cards. “I want a rematch!” Cosmos playfully grinned.</p><p>“Sure thing.” Lavender relaxed on the chair, learning to enjoy this strange game.</p><hr></div></article></section></main></body></html>
