                <p>It is something I had in mind thinking about the interaction between the RS team. And this is also the part that made me start shipping Jaspers and Claire together, Past the Stargazing Season has got me on a choke hold.</p>
                <p>When I start thinking electronic stuff to be our type of magic, I can start to understand Claire's fear of Mathematics, god it's painful.</p>

            <p>“AUGHHHH I CAN’T UNDERSTANDDD…” The usually composed mage-in-training slammed her head against the mock exam paper table, crying out. “I dnt wnn t do ths anymr…” She mumbled, her head burying into the table. It’s been hours since she started attempting to solve the math equation, but she just couldn’t get the expected answer.</p>

            <p>It’s exam period, students in each sectors are studying vigorously, some hoped for a good grade, while some just prayed for a simple pass. Considering Claire’s situation, she might be the latter scenario.</p>
            
            <p>Her friend with golden hair sat beside the whimpering girl, softly petted her hair. “It seems very tough to studying this subject…”</p>
            
            <p>Solar and Jaspers are both studying for the Knight’s Program, which involves close-distance combat, and battle strategies. Claire, on the other hand, is studying for the Mage’s Program, a sector focusing on spell-casting, element studies, and magic circles, a matter involving a lot of Mathematics…</p>
            
            <p>…Which is Claire’s greatest enemy.</p>
            
            <p>“While I could’ve helped you back in 9th grade, but at this level I don’t even know what’s going on in the notes…” Solar sighed. Looking at her question paper, there are strange sets of symbols, and a question asking how each magic circles operate while being influenced by one another… What even is going on? “It’s too far away from what I’ve learned, sorry…” Devastated that she couldn’t do anything for her struggling friend, she continue to stroke her hair. Jaspers silently watched the sobbing girl, he wanted to utter something, but didn’t know what to say.</p>
            
            <p>“Aghhhhh! At this rate I’m going to fail the exam!” Claire sat up, her hands clutching her head, “What if I never become a professional mage? What if I get kicked out from this place??”</p>
            
            <p>Solar wanted to comfort her, saying something like “You won’t get kicked from here!”, but she held in her initial urge, shutting her mouth. Despite how ideal this place is in Solar’s eyes, only recently she understood the reality. This place can’t afford to raise a student who can’t be excellent, they can’t let a burden stay here.</p>
            
            <p>It is fortunate Solar was gifted with high magic potential, intelligent mind and great physical powers, but those who aren’t as talented can’t even compete in this intense environment. To her, exam is a way to show off to the higher ups, to others, to her friends, it is a gate towards survival or doom.</p>
            
            <p>“Uh…” After not speaking for a while, Jaspers finally made a noise, raising the attention of both girls. “To be honest… Even you fail this test, I don’t think you are anywhere close to being kicked out, unlike me…”</p>
            
            <p>“You aren’t doing well in your subject?” Claire raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised. “Far from well actually…” Solar scratched her head.</p>
            
            <p>Joining the classes far later than the rest, Jaspers was very far behind the studies, it took him quite a long time to figure out the questions which others had already mastered. Although he had extremely good physical strength, he still lacked in strategies and courage. “Do you know what’s ridiculous? During a sword practice, he froze and failed to dodge an attack because he was too petrified by his opponent’s eyes!” Claire then let out a giggle, which she felt bad about.</p>
            
            <p>“But if the worse case scenario happens, you won’t be left out there alone.” Jaspers continued. “What do you mean?” Claire asked curiously.</p>
            
            <p>“If they kick you out, I will follow along with you.” Jaspers said, despite his fear of eye contact, there is a light of certainty and determination within him, “I will stay by your side.”</p>
            
            <p>Claire’s eyes widened and her jaws loosened, not knowing how to process this sudden emotional speech, especially not from him.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh no, you are NOT leaving this place” Solar frustratedly yelled, “NONE OF YOU will be kicked out from this place!!” Before Jaspers and Claire could react, Solar wrapped them into her arms, hugging them tightly. The sudden gesture of affection shook them both, especially Jaspers, whose muscles got tensed up and froze.</p>
            
            <p>“As the greatest knight of Luminescence, no, the greatest knight of Stardust Isle, I will NOT let anything bad happen to you guys!” While they couldn’t see Solar’s face, her voice already gave away her tearful expression. “I will protect you, and change this place and the world for better!” It’s strange the interaction went from ranting about exams to sappy stuff, but Claire held Solar tighter, embracing this tiny moment of vulnerability.</p>
            
            <p>“Who said Claire will be leaving alone?” A thin figure emerged from the open door, Grey slowly walked out, overhearing what they talked about.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh Grey, you don’t have to worry about that!” Claire brightly made a smile like usual, “I will surely pass this test!” She glanced at the paper she was struggling at, “Eventually.”</p>
            
            <p>“Maybe I can help a bit?” The young Grey waddled towards the table, grabbing her paper up. “I don’t know if you can even understand it…” Claire admitted, though she let him continue doing his thing.</p>
            
            <p>As expected, Grey tilted his head in confusion reading the complicated questions. He and Claire were as if cut from the same mold, and one thing they particularly have in common was being bad at math. In fact, why would a boy who never studied Mage’s Mathematics understand the equations and formulas? …Surprisingly, Grey’s eyes lit up, as if a lightbulb lit in his head.</p>
            
            <p>“Claire, you wrote the plus sign here as a minus!” Grey pointed at a point on the third line of her answer, it was a plus sign in the previous line, but she miswrote it as a minus, working so tirelessly has made her (and her friends) careless.</p>
            
            <p>Claire let out a gasp, “OH let me check!” He returned the paper to Claire, which she immediately corrected and recalculated the results. To everyone’s relief, after the correction, the answer come out correct.</p>
            
            <p>“AHHH GREY! You saved me from this nightmare!!!!” Claire quickly embraced the young boy in her arms, dramatically sobbing. Grey simply scratched his head in embarrassment, but not against with being showered in praises.</p>
            
            <p>“I’m glad Claire got through her obstacle,” Solar sighed in relief, “I think we should also study as well, don’t you think, Jaspers?” Standing up from her spot, her eyes gazed at the tall guy, signaling him to get going. “Yea, let’s go.” Seeing Claire recovering from her stress had brought him reassurance, and motivation to improve himself as well.</p>
            
            <p>The exam period will be difficult, but the three of them will try their best to fight on.</p>
