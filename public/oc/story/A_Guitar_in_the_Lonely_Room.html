        <h2>Part 1: The burning village</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>On a certain night, a group of guards and mages of water element were rushing towards south, where a hidden village is set abaze. As the rescuers fought against the raging flames, they were met with bodies lying on the floor, completely succumbed into the deadly smoke and inferno. With major efforts, the fire is extinguished, with any useful clues brunt to a crisp, and no survivors from the village&#8230; Except for one.</p>

            <p>A few kilometers to the west of the village, a boy was found collapsed onto the floor, unconscious but alive. His body was in very rough shape, countless wounds were all around his body, and his head was bleeding profusely. The rescuers, still haven&rsquo;t rest the whole night, quickly treated his injuries, putting all the effort to bring him back from the brink of death.</p>
            
            <p>At last, their efforts were not unpaid. The bleeding stopped, his condition returned to stability. After this incident, the people in Luminesce pondered about the mystery of the village. What happened there, does the boy have something to do with the fire? After the boy awakened, the clan leaders prepared some questions for him. However, the answers given&#8230; were quite unsatisfactory.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Are you one of the residents of the village?&rdquo; &ldquo;&#8230;I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;How did the village got set on fire?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&#8230;&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>With every question, it only brought both the questioners and the boy more confusion. Perhaps he was suffering from memory loss, which wasn&rsquo;t surprising considering from his head trauma. There is only one question he was able to answer.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Jaspers, this is my name&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>Part 2: A new member</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>“What should we do with him? We can’t let someone who potentially burnt down a village stay here!” “That’s a CHILD, Martin! There’s no way to justify leaving an injured child in the woods!”</p>

<p>An argument between several leaders had went on for how many hours, their yellings filled the room with noise. And yet the child wasn’t very fased by that, his expression remained blank, his emotionless eyes staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>An decision has been made, like any other child they picked up, they will let Jaspers, the new member of the Luminescence, stay in a quiet corner in the dormitory area, where a quiet hut rests.</p>

<p>“We don’t have much availible rooms in the area, you can stay in here instead.” He was brought inside the room, stacks of paper and furniture were left unorganized, was someone else living here as well?</p>

<p>“Make yourself at home.” She said, leaving the boy alone. Jaspers sat on the nearest chair, trying to process his mind. He was Jaspers, he thought to himself, but what exactly IS him? His origin, his past, it all came out blank. He stared at the ticking clock on the wall, the second needle moves one space after the other. Perhaps the answer would come with time.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Weeks has past, one of the mentors came to treat his wounds, like usual.</p>

<p>“Your injures has healed quite quickly! Though the scar on your face seems to not fade…” She rambled as she unwrapped the bandages on his head and body.</p>

<p>“So… your memories still haven’t returned?” Jaspers answered with a nod. “Well this isn’t very good…” The mentor scratched her head, it seemed the only answer to the village was already buried away.</p>

<p>“Anyways, I think there is no need for bandages anymore, perhaps you can go outside more and join your peers!” Jaspers’ gaze moved to the window, from the outside, a few teens were playing ball catching. To his realisation, it seems he hadn’t interacted with people much aside from treatment and questioning his past, perhaps he should try being the one to start an interaction instead…</p>

<p>However, it seems making friends isn’t as easy as the mentor mentioned. Everytime he walked up to a group of young people, whether if it were teens or those around the same age as him, they always give the same look, widened eyes and frowns. Then they would pace away from him, leaving Jaspers back to solitude.</p>

<p>He went up to the taller figures, who were most likely the mentors. “Perhaps you should try looking more friendly!” They said, “Try smiling more!” He stared at the kids having fun on the back, their faces light with the corners of their mouths risen, like the cresent moon. Once again, he walked up to the group, imitating the expression like they did.</p>

<p>It went even worse. Not only did their smiles turned into frowns, they all ran away screaming, some of them even crying. Jaspers stood in place, not understanding what he did wrong. Perhaps, he wasn’t built for human interaction, he thought.</p>

        <h2>Part 3: Strange notes</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>He returned to his room, empty like usual, with the ticking of the clock keeping the room from complete silence. Maybe he should clean up the room first, he thought to himself. As he picked up a book and attempted to shove it onto a bookshelf, the balance for the books and paper piles broke. And with all of a sudden, the piles of heavy books and sheets poured down onto him like a landslide, burying him.</p>

<p>Recovering from the surprise, Jaspers stood himself back up, rubbing his forehead from the ache. Then the sight caught his interest, the pages fell onto the floor contained a bunch of strange symbols and dots with tails placed onto parallel, horizontal lines. It felt as if those are diaries in a language he didn’t understand, he never heard of this type of words before.</p>

<p>He picked up other sheets on the floor, which also contained the same strange symbols all over. How strange, he thought to himself, did these symbols have some meaning behind them? The strangeness of these notes motivated his curiosity to learn deeper.</p>

<p>As it turned out, among the undecipherable paper sheets, there are some which are binded together. Upon opening them, it actually contained word which he could understand.</p>

<p>“Ugh so bored so bored so bored so bored… I have nothing to do, but I don’t want to continue composing. Got no energy…” “Sigh… One year isn’t enough for me, why does time go so fast?” “The students are so loud today, can’t they quiet down a bit? I’m trying to focussss”</p>

<p>It seemed all the notes the owner wrote were often just daily ramblings and complains, groaning about how boring life is. As Jaspers flipped the pages, he found something interesting, sketches and drawings of lines and letters, something about chords and guitar?</p>

<p>One of the sketches illustrated an unusual object, an object shaped like a pear with a stick sticking out on the hole in the center. He looked at the thing that had been leaning onto the bed frame since he got here, apparently that was a guitar.</p>

<p>He examined the guitar, stickers of all sorts covering the surface. When he brushed his fingers against the wires, a gentle noise trembled from the instrument. He wondered, were the strange paper scattered around related to this instrument? He looked deeper into the notes, the dots seems to correspond to the strings on the guitar. The dots were slowing connecting together, perhaps he would be able to understand it soon.</p>

        <h2>Part 4: Insignificant Existence</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>“Congratulations on your graduation, Aqua. I will miss you so much!” A boy tearfully holds a older girl’s hands. “Oh don’t be too sad Cal, I will come visit you guys often.” From what he’s heard, after the students here reached a certain age, they get to either continue living here as a mentor or guard, or move out to start a brand new life. “I really wished I can stay here longer, but I guess my grades aren’t qualified to work here.” Aqua awkwardly scratched her head, “Well I can always look for other places!”</p>

<p>Jaspers watched the group’s farewell party from a distance… Wait, why was he outside again? Oh yea, he was grabbing lunch. With a lunch box in his hand, he walked back to his room.</p>

<p>Slowly savouring the box of chicken salad, he contemplated about the future. What would he do when he leaves this place? What did adults even do outside? As he finished the last bite, he picked up a notebook, with the name “Blaze” written on the cover. Opening the page with the bookmark, he continued on where he left off.</p>

<p>In the days reading the strange notes, aside from understanding the strange symbols and playing the guitar, he also got to learn about the owner, who called themself by the name “Blaze” (Though they mentioned it was just a pen name). From what he could see, the content was a mix of music composing and complaining about life. Sometimes Jaspers would learn about how to play the guitar a bit better, and other times he would have to go through paragraphs of ranting on how annoying his classmates were. Sounded quite like a bitter person, at least his notes were somewhat entertaining.</p>

<p>An hour or two had passed, he put down the notebook, and placed back onto the bookshelf. As Jaspers stretched, wondering if he should continue reorganising the room, his gaze were guided to another notebook, its cleaniness standing out from the others. He wasn’t planning on reading this long originally, but it was as if the notebook was calling out for him. There’s no harm in reading another page, he thought, and he opened the first page.</p>

<p>“To whoever reading this, by the time you have my notebooks, it is likely that I’m already dead.”</p>

<p>The sudden serious tone surprised Jaspers, the words which used to be a simple record of the previous owner, are now communicating to him directly.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow, or the day after I write this, will be the day of my graduation. The teachers, the kids, are congratulating me and my class on finally becoming a full fledged adult. We are finally free to live on our own, maybe start our own clans to raise our own pupils, and we can explore the world on our own… But that’s just what they claimed…”</p>

<p>Blaze’s tone was always been somewhat negative, but this time it was like there was an extra feeling of dread around their words.</p>

<p>“If you don’t understand their true intentions behind the graduation ceremonies, you are either too young, or too gullible for this world. Anyways, moving out from this place is nothing to be celebrated about, it’s more like a death sentence…”</p>

<p>It feels as if Blaze was in front of him, telling Jaspers to sit down and prepare for the horrible truth, while the face obscured away by text explains with an expression of anger and despair.</p>

<p>“If you pay attention to your surrondings just a little bit, you will already understand how dangerous the current world is. One second you are completely fine walking around the woods, the next second, your bodies may be torn apart by the raging wind, fire, monsters, or whatever things are out there.”</p>

<p>“…And if it was this dangerous outside, why would the people here allow these young adults to live out there alone?”</p>

<p>It felt like the invisible face belonging to these words were glaring at Jaspers, making him question the true nature behind this clan.</p>

<p>“No, even if you become old enough to learn advanced magic or battle tactics, those who deemed themselves strong still couldn’t save themselves from becoming another victim of nature. Let me tell you the true reason why they let their students into the lion’s maw: They don’t want to keep those worthless to them.”</p>

<p>Jaspers’ eyes widened, unprepared for the harsh answer.</p>

<p>“You see, the state of the world is so difficult, clans and villages are trying so hard to save their resources. However, the amount of kids and young people keeping coming in, it would be quite difficult to allocate resources when there’s not much to begin with. While some clans would just abandon the kids, this clan is still willing to raise them, which I will give credit for.”</p>

<p>“However, the reason they keep us around is because they want to maintain a good image within this community, and find some unpolished gems among the pebbles and rocks. And when they reach adulthood, if they have proven themselves useful, they are able to stay, becoming the people who protects this place. And for those who don’t, they are ‘graduated’ from this place, or in better words, kicked out. How long do you think these people, deemed not strong enough, are able to survive out there?”</p>

<p>Jaspers began thinking about his life here. While the teachers took care of his basic needs, he hadn’t done anything useful for this place yet. It seemed like the mentors didn’t know what to do with him after the few weeks he arrived. So far, he had only stayed in his own room, doing nothing but read some stranger’s notes, who might have died outside.</p>

<p>Will… will he end up like them?</p>

<p>“And you might have already guessed, I’m not good enough for this clan. Actually, I’m far from the standard, I sucked. I’m bad at physical activities, my magic abilities are weak, and don’t get me started in my studies. The only thing I’m good at is music, but music isn’t going to help protecting the people.”</p>

<p>The tone of the notes slightly shifted, from anger to sadness.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps it’s my fault that I’m this way. Maybe if I had spent more time studying instead of that song I’m trying to complete, things would be better. But in the end, it is left unfinished, I failed at the very last thing I’m supposed to be good at…”</p>

<p>“I wish I have more time, and even live a longer life, so that I can do the things I want to do, and finish that music I worked so hard on. If life is a bit kinder, maybe I wouldn’t feel so lonely, maybe I would be accepted by my peers, and share my art with them. I wish I hadn’t been just a silent gust of wind in everyone’s lives, I want to be remembered… But is there even a point in wishing? I don’t deserve it anyway…”</p>

<p>“Reader, whoever you are, if you can, please keep my things around. Even if I die, I want my existence to be remembered in some way. Just for a while, please remember how pathetically I tried to live, and how badly I failed at life. Despite being ignored and pushed away for my entire life, I’m so scared of being forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Blaze”</p>

<p>Upon flipping the next page, pages of music sheets are placed between the pages. And on the sheet at the most bottom, the notes are left unfinished, like how Blaze’s life was cut short.</p>

<p>Jaspers’ silently sat on the chair, processing what he just read. A minute later, he grabbed the guitar placed near the bed, with the music composed by Blaze, Jaspers slowly strummed the guitar, trying to listen to what they have created.</p>

<p>Despite the horrors of his future, Jaspers didn’t feel much fear or anxiety about having the same fate as Blaze in the future. To him, it always felt like being forgotten by life is a normal part of his existence. He came into this world without knowing how, and he knew someday, he was going to leave this world without anyone remembering him.</p>

<p>What he felt the most, was empathy towards the author, a person he never met face to face. While he might not know if Blaze would like his personality, what Jaspers knew is that they felt very lonely. They wanted a friend who they can chat with, someone to share their music with. Perhaps, if Blaze was still here when Jaspers arrived, maybe they would’ve been close, as outcasts who were bad with people…</p>

<p>Jaspers closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, taking in the sorrow and hopelessness within the melody. While Blaze might not be around anymore, he decided to be the one to continue their music journey, allowing Blaze’s existence to live on with him.</p>
