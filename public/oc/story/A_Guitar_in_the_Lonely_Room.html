          <p>Losing all memories, Jaspers was taken into the clan of Luminescence. In the days of loneliness, he learnt about a person he never met through strange notes.</p>

          <h2>Author notes</h2>
          <p>Jaspers' backstory is one of the OC backstories I first developed, his story doesn't impact the overall lore as much (in fact his backstory being not relevant to the overall lore is important to his writing), he's also an OC I felt very connected to.</p>
          <p>If you know about how I developed Jaspers as a character, he went from a edgelord to some nervous guy. I kinda want to keep that old part of him, so I tried to make it into an imaginary para-friend?</p>
          <p>I also added some creativity by adding paper texture and font styles to Blaze's notes, inspired by <a href="https://puddingpudd.com/Writing/Phoenix_Club">Pudding's Phoenix Club Chapter 10</a>!</p>

        <h1>Part 1: The burning village</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>On a certain night, a group of guards and mages of water element were rushing towards south, where a hidden village is set abaze. As the rescuers fought against the raging flames, they were met with bodies lying on the floor, completely succumbed into the deadly smoke and inferno. With major efforts, the fire is extinguished, with any useful clues brunt to a crisp, and no survivors from the village&#8230; Except for one.</p>

            <p>A few kilometers to the west of the village, a boy was found collapsed onto the floor, unconscious but alive. His body was in very rough shape, countless wounds were all around his body, and his head was bleeding profusely. The rescuers, still haven&rsquo;t rest the whole night, quickly treated his injuries, putting all the effort to bring him back from the brink of death.</p>
            
            <p>At last, their efforts were not unpaid. The bleeding stopped, his condition returned to stability. After this incident, the people in Luminesce pondered about the mystery of the village. What happened there, does the boy have something to do with the fire? After the boy awakened, the clan leaders prepared some questions for him. However, the answers given&#8230; were quite unsatisfactory.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Are you one of the residents of the village?&rdquo; &ldquo;&#8230;I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;How did the village got set on fire?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&#8230;&rdquo;</p>
            
            <p>With every question, it only brought both the questioners and the boy more confusion. Perhaps he was suffering from memory loss, which wasn&rsquo;t surprising considering from his head trauma. There is only one question he was able to answer.</p>
            
            <p>&ldquo;Jaspers, this is my name&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>Part 2: A new member</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>“What should we do with him? We can’t let someone who potentially burnt down a village stay here!” “That’s a CHILD, Martin! There’s no way to justify leaving an injured child in the woods!”</p>

<p>An argument between several leaders had went on for how many hours, their yellings filled the room with noise. And yet the child wasn’t very fased by that, his expression remained blank, his emotionless eyes staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>An decision has been made, like any other child they picked up, they will let Jaspers, the new member of the Luminescence, stay in a quiet corner in the dormitory area, where a quiet hut rests.</p>

<p>“We don’t have much availible rooms in the area, you can stay in here instead.” He was brought inside the room, stacks of paper and furniture were left unorganized, was someone else living here as well?</p>

<p>“Make yourself at home.” She said, leaving the boy alone. Jaspers sat on the nearest chair, trying to process his mind. He was Jaspers, he thought to himself, but what exactly IS him? His origin, his past, it all came out blank. He stared at the ticking clock on the wall, the second needle moves one space after the other. Perhaps the answer would come with time.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Weeks has past, one of the mentors came to treat his wounds, like usual.</p>

<p>“Your injures has healed quite quickly! Though the scar on your face seems to not fade…” She rambled as she unwrapped the bandages on his head and body.</p>

<p>“So… your memories still haven’t returned?” Jaspers answered with a nod. “Well this isn’t very good…” The mentor scratched her head, it seemed the only answer to the village was already buried away.</p>

<p>“Anyways, I think there is no need for bandages anymore, you should go outside more and join your peers.” Jaspers’ gaze moved to the window, from the outside, a few teens were playing ball catching. To his realisation, it seems he hadn’t interacted with people much aside from treatment and questioning his past, like what his mentor said, maybe he should try bonding with the other kids.</p>

<p>Being a quiet child, Jaspers was quite shy about meeting new people. Even though the teens seemed friendly enough, it took the mentor a few more encouragements to get him walk outside the door. After a while, Jaspers finally approached the teens, when they turned their heads to him, their curious faces turned into unease, then nervously walked away.</p>
<p>Feeling confused, Jaspers returned to the mentor again. The mentor was tidying a stack of documents with words he didn't understand, she spoke without turning her head from the papers, "Not sure what happened, but maybe you should try again, with a friendly tone and smile?" After hearing that advice, he took a breath and went outside, meeting the playing kids yet again. The teens' faces went tense again, in fear of the strange child standing there. Jaspers followed that simple advice as carefully as possible, a kind greeting, and a welcoming smile...</p>
<p>The mentor finished reordering the documents, and let out a sigh, relaxing from a day of busy work. Not a second later, she heard a knock from the door, and from the entrance she was shocked to see a teary-eyed Jaspers, holding his forehead in pain, "They screamed and smacked me with the ball..."</p>
<p>Needless to say, he didn't have the courage to speak to his peers for a long while.</p>

        <h2>Part 3: Strange notes</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>He returned to his room, empty like usual, with the ticking of the clock keeping the room from complete silence. Maybe he should clean up the room first, he thought to himself. As he picked up a book and attempted to shove it onto a bookshelf, the balance for the books and paper piles broke. And with all of a sudden, the piles of heavy books and sheets poured down onto him like a landslide, burying him.</p>

<p>Recovering from the surprise, Jaspers stood himself back up, rubbing his forehead from the ache. Then the sight caught his interest, the pages fell onto the floor contained a bunch of strange symbols and dots with tails placed onto parallel, horizontal lines. It felt as if those are diaries in a language he didn’t understand, he never heard of this type of words before.</p>

<p>He picked up other sheets on the floor, which also contained the same strange symbols all over. How strange, he thought to himself, did these symbols have some meaning behind them? The strangeness of these notes motivated his curiosity to learn deeper.</p>

<p>As it turned out, among the undecipherable paper sheets, there are some which are binded together. Upon opening them, it actually contained word which he could understand.</p>

<div class="paper">
  <p>Ugh soboredsoboredsoboredsobored… I have nothing to do, but I don’t want to continue composing. Got no energy…</p>
<p>One year isn’t enough for me, why does time go so fast?</p>
<p>The students are so loud today, can’t they quiet down a bit? I’m trying to focussss</p>
</div>

<p>It seemed all the notes the owner wrote were often just daily ramblings and complains, groaning about how boring life is. "This person sure complains a lot", he thought. As Jaspers flipped the pages, he found something interesting, sketches and drawings of lines and letters, something about chords and guitar?</p>

<p>One of the sketches illustrated an unusual object, an object shaped like a pear with a stick sticking out on the hole in the center. He looked at the thing that had been leaning onto the bed frame since he got here, apparently that was a guitar.</p>

<p>He examined the guitar, stickers of all sorts covering the surface. When he brushed his fingers against the wires, a gentle noise trembled from the instrument. He wondered, were the strange paper scattered around related to this instrument? He looked deeper into the notes, the dots seems to correspond to the strings on the guitar. The dots were slowing connecting together, perhaps he would be able to understand it soon.</p>

        <h2>Part 4: Left and Forgotten</h2>
        <p>“Congratulations on your graduation, Aqua. I will miss you so much!” A boy tearfully holds a older girl’s hands. “Oh don’t be too sad Cal, I will come visit you guys often.” From what he’s heard, after the students here reached a certain age, they get to either continue living here as a mentor or guard, or move out to start a brand new life. “I really wished I can stay here longer, but I guess my grades aren’t qualified to work here.” Aqua awkwardly scratched her head, “Well I can always look for other places!”</p>
        <p>Jaspers peeked at the commontion outside from the window, it seems one of the students would be leaving that day. He didn't know that person though, so he moved on to do his own thing, which is reading the notebooks.</p>
        <p>Jaspers had spent a lot of time reading the notes. Not only were there plenty of drafts and progresses of the unnamed song the person wrote, there were also plenty of rambles. </p>
        <p>"<u>Blaze</u>, a Fire-element Knight..." Jaspers spoke to himself as he read through the notebooks. He had asked the teachers about this person, and yet noone recalled who that person was. Perhaps it had been a long time since that person graduated from here, and the teachers lost track of their students' names.</p>
        <p>But it might not be too surprising none of them remembered them, among the outstanding magic users in Luminescence, they weren't particularly... great to interact with.</p>
        <div class="paper">
          <p>Once again, I could not impress them with my powers. The teachers only like those who are obedient and knows useful skills and not art, <s>they never care about my music</s>Oh who cares about what teachers think, I've got my own hobbies that's I enjoy. Unlike these people-pleasers, I'd rather be alone than pretend to be someone that I'm not.</p>
          <p>These kids... They laze around and do nothing, <s>and yet they managed to be stronger than me </s> they only rely on talent to seem strong and cool. At least I try my best in everything I do, one day they will realize what they have been missing out!</p>
        </div>
        <p>"I don't think it's the kind of personality people like to hang out with" Jaspers thought, as he closed off the last page of the current notebook. When he went to the bookshelf for another notebook, he only then noticed something: The one on the shelf is the last one. It's somewhat bittersweet finishing reading someone else's personal diary without permission, but the original owner might find relief that this invasion of privacy is over soon.</p>
        <p>Upon the first page, the pattern of the notebook felt different from the rest. Instead of short sentences of ramblings separated by days, it was long paragraphs written in a day.</p>
        <div class="paper">
          <p>Tomorrow, it will be the day I finally graduate from this place, growing up into a independent person, living as a proud <s>Fire Knight</s> Oh who am I kidding they don't even see me as a knight here??? They never even sent me to Knight classes for how <i>awful I am at battling</i>. I'm just a simple explorer here, not that it's bad, but who cares about studying the lands and gathering stuff when you can wield swords?</p>
        <p>Anyways, what's good about graduating anyways, there's nothing stable outside. With how little I can fight, I wouldn't survive a day. They made students graduate just because they couldn't take care of everyone!</p>
        <p>Jaspers thought about the person graduating today, somewhat worried about her.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paper">
          <p>I know I don't like this place, but I don't know, it's not like I'm strong enough to be recuited anywhere else. After the life I've gone through, and everything I've done over the years, is this what it all leads up to? To be left behind and forgotten? I never liked to talk to people, they would all look at me, deep down feeling grateful that this loser is finally leaving. Nobody would miss me when I'm gone, and nobody would remember me after tomorrow. This makes sense, and yet I feel scared. I said I'm fine to be alone, but why do I feel scared now?</p>
        <p>I don't want tomorrow to come, I don't want to be forgotten.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Jaspers flipped the next page, hoping to see more of their words.</p>
        <div class="paper"><p><br><br><br><br></p></div>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
