        <p>"Cosmos, why do you want to save the world so much?" While walking in the dark woods, Lavender asked the winged cat.</p>
        <p>"Why do you ask?" Cosmos replied, "If the world ends, we all won't survive."</p>
        <p>"Yes. But, not everyone has the courage to face the potential danger hidden behind the shadows." Lavender continued, "When we first met, it seemed like you have a very strong will to protect this world from destruction, and I felt like you have some sort of reason for this."</p>
        <p>Cosmos then proudly explained, "Well, cometlings are born with power so as to protect their planet and the people. Why should we abandon such imprtant mission when the whole world in our hands? This is what I am destined to do!"</p>
        <p>"I see... But have you thought of this: " Lavender's expression seemed to change. "The <a href="/oc/secret/fate.html" class="secret">mission</a> you are given, what if the mission is never possible to complete? Or what if the powers you are given is far from enough to do anything? If the world is too far gone to be saved, will you still try to protect it from doom?"</p>
        <p>"I don't see why saving the world is impossible. I might have lost my memories, and my powers are not functioning as normal, but with you, my friend, I'm sure we can do anything." Cosmos said quite confidently.</p>
        <p>"Is that so..." Lavender was not exactly satisfied with that idealistic answer, but she decided to not continue this topic for now.</p>
        <p>In the distance, the two travellers saw a faint light.</p>
        <p>"It's been a while I've seen the outside world..." From Lavender's tone, Cosmos could feel a hint of nervousness in her words.</p>
        <p>The cat comforted her, "Don't worry, the land may be full of danger, it can be also a place to meet new allies!"</p>
        <p>In Lavender's mind, that is exactly the problem. She can never know if the people can be trusted, especially in a world in such an awful state.</p>
        <p>"Hope things will go well at least." They slowly stepped out of the darkness, entering the light of unknown...</p>
