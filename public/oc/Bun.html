      <center><i>"A stern and myterious person, living in the woods, they always came prepared for the most unexpected events. While often wearing quite formal clothing, Bun claimed that they had been kicked out of their royal household due to being too weak. Is it because of this, they were never seen using magic? This strange person seemed to be present mostly to keep this friend group out of trouble and danger, while staying out of their business, but their kindness seemed to have touched their heart. For they wanted to protect what they cared for, they joined the team into the Voided Lands, bracing themselves for what's awaiting them."</i></center>

        <h2><center>Facts about them</center></h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Outside of doing physically-demanding activities, they enjoyed wearing fancy clothing</li>
        <li>Despite their short height, they are quite fit!</li>
        <li>Bun could sound mean sometimes, but they always care about their friends</li>
        <li>Bun seemed to not want to share what their power was, perhaps due to their past</li>
        <li>However, they seemed to grow familiar with the team's personalities very quickly, despite only meeting them for a short period of time</li>
        <li>They often over-prepared things, and maybe bringing too much things in their bag even when unnecessary</li>
        <li>Why did Bun wear those bunny ears? They said it's decoration, but that's a strange choice for sure...</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <ul>
        <li>In the old concepts, they had bunny ears and wings as well</li>
        <li>Wings will surely be removed, but bunny ears... I might consider keeping them, for lore reasons</li>
        <li>Cosmos used to be close with Bun in concept ideas, not anymore tho lol</li>
        <li>I named them for convenience (and little as a joke, because they are bunny-like), but then the name grew on me, and here we are</li>
