        <center><i>" This gloomy boy may look cold at first. However, he often acts like an kind older brother, taking care of others especially those younger than him. It is said that Grey wishes to be as powerful and reliable as his mentor, who left for a mission and went missing. Grey seems to avoid using magic, and is often very cautious around his surrondings. Nevertheless, when danger arrives, he will not hesitate to protect his allies, no matter the opponent. "</i></center>

        <center><h2>Facts about him:</h2></center>
          <ul>
          <li>The gemstone on his necklace was given by Claire</li>
          <li>Despite how strong his electric magic is, his own powers can hurt himself badly</li>
          <li>Though he is afraid of thinking about it, deep down he can't help thinking his friends are long gone...</li>
          <li>He accidentally burnt his coat, that why it is charred.</li>
          <li>Unfortunately, he is bad at Math</li>
          <li>He is a bit too self-critical, he kinda blames himself for the disappearance of his friends.</li>
          <li>He does enjoy doing art stuff</li>
          <li>Maybe Grey had lighter hair when he was younger?</li>
          </ul>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>He is one of my oldest OCs ( along with Claire ), but his current design looks nothing like his old one</li>
          <li>I was following an art tutorial and the two characters I drew came out quite nice, and I made them my OCs, which are Grey and Claire now.</li>
          <li>This new design is inspired by his old name 薄霧城·灰銘, given by a friend</li>
          <li>薄霧城 can be interpreted as "city in light fog"</li>
          <li>灰 means grey, 銘 means to carve, so together his name can mean "Carved in grey"</li>
          <li>Claire and him were intended to be siblings, but after weird world-building stuff, I changed that</li>
          <li>His character motif is thunder and fog</li>
          </ul>
