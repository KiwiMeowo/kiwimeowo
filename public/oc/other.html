      <p>There are OCs that are somewhat important to the story and I really wanna share them, but they are severely incomplete. So I opened this page to briefly note down my ideas.</p>

      <div class="box"><h1>New Characters!?</h1><div class="inner min">
      <p>You've guessed it, I have birthed new OCs today! I figured if Mira wanted to save the world or smth, she would need more than just herself. Therefore, I drew three more characters, and with two older characters I had. That would make one for each element. The elements are Water: River, Energy: Frost, and Dark: Telekinesis (This one I'm still figuring out). The two extra characters are the knight dude(Light element) and a pretty lady(Nature: Flora), I'll show the designs in the future.</p>

      <p>When I was a kid, I drew myself as a magical hero, and bullies as the villains, and I always beat them up in my imagination. I brought back the concept, not villains, but still a menace to society.</p>

      <p>First one is Raven, the second one hasn't been named. (Bastards)</p>
      </center>
      <p>In the story, they are close bros that cause trouble and maybe aims to conquer the world. However, due to certain events, they fell out. Raven might be working under Mira's team, while the other guy would probably join Lavender's team (poor them). They will make up (make out /j) in the future tho.</p>
      <p>Raven is a coffee addict and a scientist, and when you talk to him, he would not hesitate to insult you if you irritate him ever so slightly. But if he puts on his raven mask, he would be more energetic and cocky (He's probably a furry).</p>
      <p>I haven't named this dude, let's call him A for the time being. You can see A as an average middle-school kid, constantly make fun of people and say curse words for the lols. His element is Water: Flow, he does not control water, but he IS the water. To explain briefly is that he becomes very flexible and speedy, and even be immune to attacks for a short period. He is an engineer that builds robots. With Raven, they are a perfect team.</p>
