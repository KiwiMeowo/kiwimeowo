      <p>The people of this land is a bit unlike ordinary humans, they are not made of flesh and blood, but magic essence. In fact, all life beings are made with magic. When magic condenses onto leaves or grass, they form into tiny gems, which may become sentient. When they grow larger, they may become animals or humans. Depending on the type of gems formed, the beings will have different magic types. When a child is found, a mentor should take care of them. Humans have high magic capacity and abilities than animals, and able to learn around three unique skills.</p>

      <h2>Method of Magic</h2>
      <p>The most common method of magic usage is convert magic essence from one's body into external power, this is called<mark> primary magic</mark>. There are basic magic skills everyone should be able to learn according to their own magic types. But if they became experts, they may find powerful abilities that they themselves can only master. </p>
      <p>Aside from directly using your own magic essence, there are alternatives, which is<mark> secondary magic</mark>. You can extract magic from other matters or life beings, and apply it onto weapons or contain it. You can also draw magic circles to draw magic from surronding areas, although this is more time-consuming and requires more drawing skills. These can help you boost your powers or help you out if you are out of juice.</p>

      <h2>The Tower of the Divine</h2>
      <p>It is said that this tower, which is located at the center of the Stardust Isle, was once the home to the creator of this world. But in the current days, it is maintained by a team called The Sky Pioneer who promised to save the world from doom and bring back to glory days. However, ever since Mira passed away, the actions of this team has been kept secretive. Just what are they planning?</p>

      <h2>Voided Lands</h2>
      <p>Stardust Isle used to be a lot larger. However, since long ago, the parts of the earth was consumed by some sort of pure black substance. Any efforts of removing it has been futile, and all life that came near it quickly got ill. With no choice, the areas consumed by the void was barred from entering. As years go by, the Voided Lands kept increasing in size, and with the population quickly declining, all prohibition from entering and recovering has ceased. But perhaps, there are secrets laying inside of this area?</p>

      <h2>Communities</h2>
      <p>As you know human families don’t work the same here, people live in a community/village which is similar to academies. There is the leader, many mentors that will take care and educate the younger ones, and the students. Depending on the community, they will accept students of different magic types or capabilities.</p>
