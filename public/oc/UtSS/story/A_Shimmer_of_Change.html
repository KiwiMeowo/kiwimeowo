The young boy had been laying in bed for what felt like eternity, he stared at the window, the sky was dull and dim, as if it was a representation of his future.</p><p>“Is there nothing we can do for Grey?” A voice echoed from outside the room, “He hadn’t got to play outside for a long time, he must be very lonely.</p><p>Another voice spoke, “There isn’t much treatment for him right now I’m afraid. While this condition isn’t exactly uncommon, his is more severe than most others. And with the limited resources at the moment… We will have to just let him rest for the time being.”</p><p>From his earliest memories, he had always had a frail body, unsuited for his destructive electric powers. As a result of that, he often found himself easily exhausted. And in such a body, there’s no safe way for him to use magic like those around him. Looking through the window, he saw a group of kids, aged just like him, learning to cast magic with guide sticks. If only he could play outside, even just once…</p><p>“Hello” Startled by the sudden noise, Grey shifted his head towards the direction of the voice. A girl, probably several years older than him, was standing near his bed, with her right hand holding a pencil. “Wanna see something cool?” She asked, voice sounding nasally due to her blocked nose.</p><p>As confused as he was, he was curious, “Mhm” he nodded his head timidly. With the reply, the girl kneeled down, drawing a surprisingly neat circle, and some unusual patterns inside it. Grey moved his body closer to the girl, he was not often allowed near magic-related things, in fear of his body reacting to them. He observed the circle closely, intrigued by the complexity of the magic circle.</p><p>The girl looked up, making sure this boy was watching her every step. She placed her pencil down, then put her hands over the magic circle. “Watch this” The girl whispered, Grey stared at the magic circle, waiting for something to happen. Like sun ray shining between the dark clouds, the circle began luminating the room with a gentle blue light. And from the light, dropslets of clear liquid emerged from the ground, fascinating the boy and even the spell-caster. As the spell continued, the droplets floated into the air, slowly forming together, becoming one single crystal.</p><p>At some point, the circle eventually stopped glowing, the crystal dropped onto the ground, its colors shifted into a shade of emerald. “Cool, this one is green here!” The young girl held the gem above her eye, pondering the gemstone she just conjured. Grey simply stared at the young wizard, his mind hadn’t not moved on from the magical experience moments ago.</p><p>“Claire, there you are!” A tall figure paced into the room, “You should’ve asked me before you ran off.” The witch lifted her hat, wiping off her sweat off her fore head.</p><p>“Look, look! The gems look different in every room I draw the circle!” Claire grabbed more gemstones from her pocket, in her hands showed stones in all sorts of colors.</p><p>“I suppose the colors are determined by the concentration of magic types, but I did not expect such a drastic change in such small range of area…” The tall witch drifted off for a moment, “Anyways you should go back to the class, there are more spells that you will find fun!” She said as she gestured to leave the room, walking away from the door.</p><p>“Oki” Claire tucked the gemstones back into her pocket. She looked up to the boy on the bed, “Do you wanna join us?”</p><p>Grey frowned, “I wish I could, but the adults said I’m too weak to go outside…”</p><p>Claire froze for a split second, seemingly having realised why this boy stayed in this room when every kid was playing outside. She then put her hand into her pocket, out pulled the green gemstone.</p><p>“You can keep it, my mentor said these gemstone got superpowers or something!” Claire placed down the gem into Grey’s tony hand. “Maybe they will help you get better soon!”</p><p>Grey held the strange stone closer to his face, it was shiny for sure, but he was uncertain how it could help him. Regardless, something within his heart felt warmer despite the cool temperatures which bothered him. “Thank you Claire!” Grey smiled, finally found a budding friendship.</p><p>“Claire?” The mentor called out to the girl. “Coming!” Claire sprinted out the door, but not before shouting back to Grey’s room, “I will come visit you again!”</p><p>Day and night, night and day, the young boy had been laying in bed for as long as he remembered. But this time, he has a friend whom he can spend time with, and learn magic together.</p><hr></div></article></section></main></body></html>
