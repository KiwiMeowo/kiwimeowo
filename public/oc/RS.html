        <li>His skill was not named due to the lack of information</li>
        <li>He struggled a lot with his emotions, he often pretended to be calm and avoided conflict</li>
        <li>He might not be talkative, but he enjoyed the company of his friends (especially Claire) a lot</li>
        <li>He didn't enjoy fighting that much, due to being forced to training when he was young</li>
        <!--<li>He was able to imitate villain laughs... A useless (?) skill he learnt from watching shows I guess</li>-->
        <li>Nobody really knew why he didn't wear shirts, not even he knew</li>
        <li><a href="/art/comic/charm1.html">He was quite bad at smiling, people gets scared when he did that</a></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <li>In the old concepts, he used to have animal ears and wings like Cosmos, but honestly just one cat-person is enough</li>
        <li>He also used to have some sort of rivalry with Cosmos, well now he doesn't even know her, i guess?</li>
        <li>He used to at least wear a tanktop, but since Cosmos is already wearing one, I decided to take his top off, sorry Jaspers</li>
