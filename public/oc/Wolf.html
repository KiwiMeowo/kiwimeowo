Instead, he wants to team up with the 'Great Scientist Raven', and take over the world! Despite saying this, why isn't he with that said friend, but instead, sticks with Lavender's team? Currently, he is bothering the travellers, causing tomfoolery every step they go, just what does this boy want?"</i></center>

        <center><h2>Facts about him:</h2></center>
        <ul>
          <li>He was very close with Raven, but something seemed to have happened between the two...</li>
          <li>He changed his name to Wolf because it sounds way cooler</li>
          <li>The equipment he's wearing is gifted by Raven</li>
          <li>His main magic ability is to be formless like water, and can get through obstacles and attacks</li>
          <li>His stamina is rather low</li>
          <li>He has a special ability which he'd rather not show off</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <ul>
          <li>He is based off my childhood OCs, which were based off my school bullies LOL</li>
          <li>He and Raven are planned to be Lavender's travel companions initially (like, back in 2021-ish), now it's just Wolf here</li>
          <li>He is named Wolf because from what I know, wolves are close friends with ravens</li>
