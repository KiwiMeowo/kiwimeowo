      <div class="box"><h1 style="text-align: center;">Dreamland Workshop</h1><div class="inner">
      <p class="text">The Dreamland Workshop is a ring-shaped architecture, surronding the planet referred as<u> the Globe</u>. Despite how hidden this place is, the area is shockingly large. The building mainly uses <a href="secret/sacredmagic.html" class="secret">time magic</a> as power source, and can be easily reversed when damage or error occurs.</p>

      <h2>Maintenance of the universe</h2>
      <p class="text">The universe was neglected by its original creator for a long time, this is why universe is very vulnerable, and is very prone to dying. The main goal of this facility is to keep the Globe from dying. Aside from creating dolls, Charles is in charge of altering storylines and time for building new plotlines for the universe. Don't worry, he is quite fond of story-writing too, though it may take him sometime to have a good idea.</p>

      <div class="box"><h1>Dolls</h1><div class="inner">
      <p class="text">Even with new powers, it would still be difficult to take care of such a large place with so little hands. Therefore, the goddess also offered to bring the dolls to life, so that they can help with the work.</p>
      <p class="text">Being thankful of their creation, most of the dolls are willing to work for this place. They mostly keep the workshop tidy and keep an eye on the universe. The work is divided into several sections, and dolls which different skills will be given suitable positions, for example, delivery, patrolling, collecting materials.</p>

      <h2>Magic</h2>
      <p class="text">In the creation of the dolls, the God of Heart gave them just enough magic essence to sustain life. Though it is not not enough for them to perform any magical abilities, it is still impressive they are able to move as originally lifeless beings.</p>

      <div class="box"><h1>Departments</h1><div class="inner">
      <p class="text">The ring-shaped architecture contains many departments, handling different tasks. The jobs are given depending on their appearance, abilities, and performance.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Transport</h2>
      <p class="text">The main method of transportation in this workplace is the Circular Rails, the stations run full day, so there will be different drivers for different shifts. Aside from travelling from place to place, it is also used to deliver packages and mail. The delivery department will then pick up the packages and deliver them to different places. </p>
      <h2>Resource gathering</h2>
      <p class="text">With how large the workshop is, resources can deplete very quickly. A small group of personnels are in large of searching useful materials outside the facility. Since the workshop is hidden from outside knowledge, the personnels should be stealthy and humanoid to blend into other lifeforms.</p>
      <h2>Patrolling</h2>
      <p class="text">The workplace used to be relatively safe, so guards usually took on other jobs and the team was relatively small. However, after a certain incident, the security has become tighter. Due to the enormous size of the workshop, it is almost <a href="secret/infiltration.html" class="secret">impossible</a> to patrol every single corner of this place.</p>
      <h2>History Recording</h2>
      <p class="text">Any important events or changes of the Globe should be recorded for a stable timeline. If there is any alerting changes, they should notify the leaders immediately.</p>
      <h2>Energy management</h2>
      <p class="text">While the power source is able to supply the entire facility, it is important to check if all the areas have sufficient energy. The power supply of each areas have maintenance regularly.</p>
