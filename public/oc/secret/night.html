      <article><h1>Loneliness under the Stars</h1><div class="inner">
        <div class="text">
        <p>Many years ago, Claire just joined the Luminescence, just a young girl carrying a even tinier, younger boy. During daytime, Claire was known to be a smart student who behaved (mostly) well. But during nighttime, she often sneaked off her bed, silently walking out of the dorms...</p>
        <p>"Claire! Why are you outside here? It's way past the curfew!" Solar showed up from behind the wall when she noticed Claire climbing past a fence. Panicked, Claire's grip nearly loosened from the bar, she could feel her body suddenly loose balance before she quickly holds onto the bar again, securing herself.</p>
        <p>Solar became agitated seeing her dear friend nearly getting injured, she rushed to the fence where Claire was, preparing to catch her fall, "CLAIRE! Get down first, you might get seriously hurt!"</p>
        <p>"Oh how did you know I'm here... Please don't tell anyone about this, Solar!" Claire exclaimed in a shaky voice while she was still trembling on the fence.</p>
        <p>"Why would I bother snitching on you anyway? Just where exactly are you going?"</p>
        <hr>
        <p>With in the dark forest engulfed by the bluish darkness, the two children walked past the trees. Solar glanced around her surrondings, surprised about how Claire was not afraid of going through the potentially dangerous woods. Solar spoke up in a cautious voice, "I don't think the adults will be happy about us going this far.. where is the place you want to take me?" Children around their age would normally get terrified if they ever step into this area, but Claire's tone remained steady, "Well... you will see very soon."</p>
        <p>The two finally saw the outside of the forest. As Solar followed Claire out of the woods, Solar's eyes was met with an unimaginable sight. </p>
        <p>The friends ended up in a field of teal, glowing flowers under a solemn, deep sky. Solar looked up into the sky, the countless stars freely shining down on the land.</p>
        <p>"Wow, this is sure a splendid location for stargazing. Is this why you fall asleep so easily in the morning?"</p>
        <p>Claire laughed timidly, "Haha... sorry about that. Though, it is this place that brings me comfort."</p>
        <p>She continued, "I believe that when people pass on, they ascend into the sky and become stars, watching over us with the gods. Whenever I come here, I feel a bit less lonely..."</p>
        <p>Solar raised her eyebrows, "Why do you feel lonely though? Don't you have lots of friends?"</p>
        <p>"Yea... I like my life here. But, sometimes I'm afraid that this will suddenly end." Claire's gaze lowered, despite her smile, a sense of sadness lingers around her. "As peaceful as things can be, they can also disappear abruptly. I fear that, one day, Grey, my friends, and even this home, will be lost as well..."</p>
        <p>Claire suddenly realised the gloomy tone of the conversation. She snapped back into her usual cheerful self, tucking the melancholy back into her mind. "Ah sorry! I shouldn't have said all that... hehe..." The girl laughed awkwardly, wishing Solar can forget about what came out of her mouth.</p>
        <p>"Nah you don't have to worry, this place will never go down when I'm here." Solar boasted, putting her hand on Claire's shoulder. Claire's head tilted in confusion.</p>
        <p>Solar continued with a confident smile, "You, Claire, are the one of the smartest students, able to solve difficult questions even while half-asleep. And me, the greatest guardian of this place, has never been defeated by anyone or anything. And with everyone's strength and powers, why would some random disaster or monster get rid of us?"</p>
        <p>"Claire, perhaps everything happened recently is scary. But now, you have me, and so many classmates who care about you, you are not alone anymore!"</p>
        <p>Claire's mouth dropped a little hearing that, and the shock was followed by a feeling of warmth into her heart. She may have lost so much before, but before she knew it, she already had plenty of new allies behind her back. Claire pulled Solar into an embrace, the girl with golden hair shuddered a bit from the sudden physical contact, but quickly accepted the warm hug, placing her arms on Claire's back. Claire spoke with a soft, trembling voice, "Yea, thank you... We will survive, together."</p>
        <p>With her friends by her side, she felt less afraid about the future, and enjoyed the present more. But, not until she learnt about a mysterious plant, a cure-all in the Voided Lands, did her and the friends' fate start to change...</p>
