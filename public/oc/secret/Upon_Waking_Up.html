        <p>It felt like time has been skipped for Grey. He found himself inside a dimly-lit tent, not remembering when and how he got here. But with his nauseous head and disoriented feeling, he had a brief idea what happened to him. </p>
        <p>As he sat himself up, rubbing his sore forehead, he noticed a small figure beside him, lifting her head from the bag she’s using as a headrest. It seemed Ruth have fallen asleep beside him, how long had she been there?</p>
        <p>“Good morning… or evening?” Still unsure of where or when he was, Grey tried to clear his mind by stretching. Ruth, still drowsy, took a few seconds to respond, “You were sleeping for a long time, I think it’s…” She looked outside, “Like an entire day.”</p>
        <p>Grey thought to himself, it wasn’t uncommon for him to suddenly drift into a long sleep, especially after using his powers.  But the fact Ruth had been sitting beside him for how long, she must be worried sick.</p>
        <p>“Sorry I made you worry, you should go back to your room and rest” Grey lightly smiled despite feeling he’s drifting back to sleep. And yet, Ruth’s expression was tinted with pensiveness, her brows furrowing.</p>
        <p>“My friends… back in the forest, they never likes to make me worry”, she murmured. “When they feels sick or hurt, they always say they’re fine… And the next time I see them, they would never wake up again…”</p>
        <p>“I don’t want to lose you too, Grey” Despite the child’s usual joyfulness, she showed a sadness unusual to her, but one Grey found strangely familiar in himself. Losing a close one so suddenly, he knew just how hard it can be.</p>
        <p>“What did Wolf say about me?” Grey asked. “Umm, he said you need a lot of rest, and you should be better after that.” Ruth recalled.</p>
        <p>Grey then set his hand on Ruth’s head, “Well if he said that, I think you can trust his word, he is quite experienced in healing after all” He comforted, while thinking that Wolf would probably complain being the healer of the group. “I wouldn’t want you to get sick from staying up all night either, you should remember to take care of yourself too!”</p>
        <p>Her worries had subsided a bit, “Ok, see you next morning”, Ruth looked at Grey with a bittersweet relief, before heading outside.</p>
