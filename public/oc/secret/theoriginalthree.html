        <p><i>Before the lands existed, there were three young goddesses. The lively golden goddess, one day found a little star fallen from the sky. To her surprise, the comet started talking. The little comet happily asked her to play, and talked about the wonders of magic and life. The girl joyfully showed this curious creature to her friends. Being inspired by the little comet, the cheerful girl said, "What if we made a land of magic and happiness?" With the three deity's and the little star's power, they conjured a magical land, full of art and dreams.</i></p>
        <p><i>To learn about the humanity they created, they were reborn as a human. As a gratitude, the cheerful girl granted the little comet a body of a feline, and gave it a pair of wings. Because of its origin, this creature was called a cometling.</i></p>
        <p><i>From that point on, the four friends played in the land of their dreams. Combining their powers, they became invincible, overcoming any obstacles in their way. Conflicts were solved, enemies were befriended, the world, which was small, slowly inhabited more and more humans, animals, and cometlings.</i></p>
        <p><i>However, one of the goddesses, the wise, jade goddess disappeared suddenly. And not long after, it was followed by the disappearance of the kind, pink goddess. One morning, when the people woke up, they noticed the remaining girl was nowhere to be found, and her cometling was missing as well. Perhaps they had gone through all their trials, and reascended into godhood? Maybe, the little gods is watching over us, protecting the world above the sky...</i></p></div>
