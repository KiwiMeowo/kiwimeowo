        <p><i>Before the lands existed, there was a lonely, young goddess. Devoid of any companionship, she spent her days alone, creating soulless stars. One day, she seemed to see a star shining brighter, and brighter. Until suddenly, the star fell into her hands. To her surprise, the comet started talking. The little comet happily asked her to play, and talked about the wonders of magic and life. Filled with joy and inspiration, the Goddess conjured a magical land, full of art and dreams.</i></p>
        <p><i>To learn about the humanity she created, she was reborn as a human. As a gratitude, she granted the little comet a body of a feline, and gave it a pair of wings. Because of its origin, this creature was called a cometling.</i></p>
        <p><i>From that point on, the little girl and the cometling became companions. Sharing their powers, they became invincible, overcoming any obstacles in their way. Conflicts were solved, enemies were befriended, the world, which was small, slowly inhabited more and more humans, animals, and cometlings.</i></p>
        <p><i>One morning, when the people woke up, they noticed the child was nowhere to be found, and her cometling was missing as well. Perhaps she had gone through all her trials, and reascended into godhood? Maybe, the little god is watching over us, protecting the world above the sky...</i></p></div>
