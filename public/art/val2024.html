      <article><h1>Valentines Special 2024!</h1>
        <div class="inner min text">
      <p>Album of the major characters of UtSS! I often see people doing edits of characters saying cringy Valentines quotes, and I always find them funny, espcecially if it is a death joke. However in here there will be no death jokes since you don't even know who died or how they died, it's just silly whimsical cards. Like always hover to view my comments, I don't want my rambles to disturb your enjoyment.</p>
