            <div class="text">
            <p>If you know me, you likely already know Pome is one of my top favourite characters. Pomegranate has been on top of my blorbo list for over four years, being by my side during rough or happy days.</p>
            <p>You might be surprised to hear this, but I did not immediately fall for her when I first see her. Yes, I was quite excited to see her on Cookie Run Youtube channel's community post, but that's all I thought and nothing much special. It's not until the affection system was implemented, and that one Pome sprite was added, that I actually started liking her.</p>

          <p style="text-align:center">( Seriously, isn't she adorable? )</p>
            <div class="text">
            <p>Ever since then, she became my most favourite character in Cookie Run and all of media <span style="font-size:0.66em;">(sorry Avocado)</span>. I always looked forward to any Pome content from CROB and fan content, especially when a new update comes, hoping it's darkness related. Unfortunately, despite being quite lore-relevant, she did not have much content... until 2021 November.</p>
            <p>The teaser for CRK was released, I watched the video with my heart beating insanely fast. And yes, Pome is there. As I was dying of happiness, new waves of content continued comingfor a long time, including the fact that people started hating her for torturing Dark Choco Cookie, which I cannot blame the fans.</p>
            <p>A long time has passed, I got to knew some people due to mutual interest in Pome. I currently have less interest in Cookie Run in general, but Pome still has a special place in my heart. One thing I wish is that Devsisters will elaborate on Pome's backstory.</p>

          <div class="content">
          <h1>Truly underrated character</h1>
            <div class="text">
            <p>There isn't much to her about Mutsu. She is a archer/bodyguard who cares for Tahomaru as if he's her sibling. The bond between Tahomaru, Mutsu and her brother Hyogo is shown clearly in the anime. Even if they are antagonists, seeing them interacting is very heart-warming, found family is one of my greatest weaknesses.&nbsp;<span style="color:#43586E;">( Hover to see spoilers:&nbsp;<span class="spoiler">(&nbsp;I know the anime has ended for years, but I believe this anime is not very well-known, so I'll spoiler just in case.) When Mutsu and Hyogo got killed at the final arc, I was very heartbroken, not just because my favourite character died, but also that the only people who cared about Tahomaru were gone, at that moment he was overtaken by grief and fought the main character Hyakkimaru harder.</span>&nbsp;)</span>&nbsp;Her character is simple, but that is enough for me to like her.&nbsp;<span style="font-size:0.66em">(Also she's very hot.)</span></p>
            <p>The main reason I made a collaspable for her is I want to tell you a fun fact that most people, even Dororo fans likely don't know because the fandom wiki didn't mention it. In the ending illustration of episode 23, a painting of Mutsu and Hyogo with the words "安江姉弟" in the background is shown. "姉弟" means older sister and younger brother, and "安江", which is "Yasue" in Romaji if Google Translate is correct, is the surname of the siblings. So yes,<u>&nbsp;Yasue Mutsu&nbsp;</u>is her full name.</p>

          <h1>Best boi</h1>
            <div class="text">
            <p>My process of starting my interest on Chigiri is quite normal. His feminine design stands out in the cast, and the fact he has bright pinkish-red hair hints that he has an important role despite he hadn't done much. When he revealed that he was afraid of breaking his ACL the second time, causing him to unable to run as fast as he used to, I knew I was going to enjoy his arc.</p>
            <p>And of course, Chigiri did not disappoint me. Watching the protagonist Isagi running as fast as he can just to have a chance of saving the match, Chigiri was reminded of the passion he once had when he could outrun everyone in the field and become the best. He stood up, and broke off his symbolic chains tying him down. When the opponent team least expected it, Chigiri dashes through the field and retrieves the ball in the nick of time. Running past everyone, he kicked the ball forward, and ran further,<u>&nbsp;passing the ball to himself.</u>&nbsp;Alas, Chigiri scored, saving his team.</p>
            <p>Maybe I haven't watched enough sports anime, but I absolutely love this character arc. From Chigiri nearly giving up soccer, to regaining his hopes and dreams. When he was sprinting across the field, I can feel myself cheering for him and my heart beating like crazy. I got very emotional when he said he wanted to dream again and play soccer again.</p>

            <p style="text-align:center">( I love his smile here )</p>
            <p>Watching this anime made my year, it's also one of the things that kept me up at night because nobody I know except my sister watches Blue Lock, and I can't fall asleep without sharing this joy and excitement.</p>

            <div class="content">
            <h1>This dude is insanely badass.</h1>
              <div class="text">
              <p>My first impression of this character is neutral, maybe lower than that. He looks like a standard ugly-looking antagonist whose only purpose is to be the protagonist's obstacle, once the protag is over it, this character will not be relevant ever again (At most is to be a comic relief). And during the 2nd selection 3v3 battle, it felt like the direction was within my expectations, Isagi learnt to use his teammate Barou's skills, "devouring" him, Barou even fell into despair realising<u>&nbsp;"I'm wasn't the king"&nbsp;</u> /ref. Isagi's team was very close to winning, all Barou needed to do is to pass the ball, accepting Isagi's "light"</p>
              <p><u>Except he refused.</u></p>
              <p>He knew that if he passed the ball, he wouldn't truely grow, and he wouldn't survive Blue Lock. Instead, he "devoured" Isagi, using his "light" to avoid the opponent's defense, and finally got his long-awaited goal.</p>
              <p>Back then, I thought Barou was genuinely going to pass the ball. But I felt something was off, the plot was intriguing and mind-blowing, Wouldn't it be strange if this part went so mediocre like that? If the author let Barou go the path most people expected, I don't think I would enjoy Barou as a character at all. Heck, I might even be let down by the plot of Blue Lock. I'm so glad that Barou became the character now. What's better is that in the future matches, when Barou does something, it's always something spectacular and unexpecting.&nbsp;<span style="color:#43586E;">( Hover to see spoilers:&nbsp;<span class="spoiler">Especially when Ego announced that Barou will be subbed into the U20 match, I would've been screaming if it weren't 2 in the morning. I proceeded to scream harder in my brain when Barou scored that goal.</span>&nbsp;)</span>&nbsp;And in the newest arc, Barou's performance and character arc are as great as usual. His design may not appeal to most people, but his development is perhaps one of the best among all fictional characters I've seen, those who also appreciate Barou would also agree that, man he is so badass.</p>
              <p>If you have never watched or read Blue Lock, you may be very confused. "Why is a football match so dramatic in here?" or "What do you MEAN by 'devouring'??" Well that's Blue Lock for you.</p>
