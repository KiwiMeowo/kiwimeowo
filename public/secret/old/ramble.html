      <button class="collapsible">Travelling to Okinawa ( 6 Aug 2023 )</button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>I miss Okinawa TBH</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>My aunt is going to Japan soon, so she asked me to exchange the remaining yen I have. Calculating the unholy amount of coins I collected, I was flushed by the memories staying in hotels, queuing for the washing machines with 100 yen coins in my hands, or the times I counted the 1 yen coins and 10 yen coins for vending machines. A lot of stuff happened there, but I miss Japan quite a lot.</p>
          <p>So in this post, I will write my experience travelling in Okinawa because it feels awful not having someone to infodump to, I will stop writing until I'm done or I go to sleep. But first, backstory time.</p>
          <p>My teacher sent us a form for applying to join a study tour to Okinawa, and those applied might get a sponsorship. It wouldn't hurt to give it a try, I said. A few months later, the teacher announced in class that I successfully got the sponsorship, it covers the entirety of the fees for the tour, meaning I got a free trip to Japan! For some reason, I was the only one who applied for the form in the class, so nobody I know would be joining me, that sucks.</p>
          <p>May 27 night, I had to go to the airport earlier because there were no midnight buses that work until 3a.m., so I went out at 11p.m. instead. My sister decided to accompany to the bus stop, which was very nice of her. While waiting for the bus, I shared Blue Lock fan art on twitter to my sister ( she's also a fan of Blue Lock ), and chatted what to do in Okinawa. The bus finally arrived, I said goodbye to my sister, then proceeded to enjoy the ride, listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/gEhuGPXxRrA">Curses by The Crane Wives</a>.</p>
          <p>At the airport, I gathered with my groupmates who will work together ( most of the time ). Feeling bored by the fact we will have to wait for over 5 hours, we started playing Card Against Humanity but Hong Kong version. Like the socially-awkward person I am, I do not know many of the slangs there, but somehow I never lost a round. Then finally we see the teachers, tour guides and other students gathering. We went to immigration, standard airport stuff, then I proceeded to get lost. With the help of my groupmates, I rushed to the destination with the 6 a.m. sunlight shining through the window</p>

          <center>What the heck it's so pretty</center>
          <p>Contrary to what I believed, I was not running late, everyone was still there. We took a group photo and we finally entered the plane. And of course, as celebration, I took a photo of the window and my little transparent pouch containing my Pome keychain and Timekeeper pin.</p>

      <div class="content">
      <h1>History of Lavender</h1>
        <div class="text">
        <p>It wouldnt't be fair if I explained how I created Cosmos but not Lavender, right?</p>
        <p>Lavender originated from a dream back in<u>&nbsp;25 July, 2018.</u>&nbsp;There was not much to see in my dream, but suddenly, a figure appeared. A pink-haired girl with braids wearing an oversized white blouse, staring at my with her blue eye with the other covered by her bangs. Her colors look strangely simliar to<u>&nbsp;my other OC Kyrea,</u>&nbsp;and the overall vibes oddly reminds me from<u>&nbsp;Ghost Quartz from Houseki no Kuni&nbsp;</u>( I was obsessed with this series back then ). I managed to wake up during the night, and quickly drew her appearance. Me getting out of the room seemed to have disturbed my sister who was sleeping on the top of the bunker bed, she told me to get back to sleep and I did after I finished the drawing. The very next day, I designed a full outfit for her, and gave her the name&nbsp;<u>"Yume"</u>, because she's born from a dream, how original.</p>
        <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5hg1fcq3e7vbosjrxizb0/yume_2025-Jan-02.JPEG?rlkey=ei5ijhdmh3ck6lm1vbdpx5hap&st=ze92wv20&raw=1">

        <center>( The moment she's created I feel like she's my child )</center>

        <center>( Look at my old drawing of Kyrea, man how time flies )</center>
        <p>However, she is not the only person who is born that day. After I went back to bed, another dream came to me. This time, a girl with mint-color, short hair visited. But not wanting to bother my sister again, I did not walk out of the room to draw this time. Thanks to that, my memory of her was more vague. Moreover, her design is not as appealing to me, no matter what outfit gave her, it did not feel right. Nevertheless, I wanted her to be some sort of counterpart to Yume. I called her<u>&nbsp;Mira,</u>&nbsp;which is short for<u>&nbsp;Miracle.</u></p>
        <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/duze0zw0v4a5jhnv94r5i/miraa_2025-Jan-02.png?rlkey=u1un7r85npd0apkn20uywuqro&st=xhefh9ce&raw=1">
        <center>( I'm still not satisfied of this design )</center>
        <p>With the birth of these two characters, I came up with a idea for a story for them. I imagined Yume as a wizard whose job is to guard the gates of the world of dreams, and Mira as an adventurous girl who accidentally got lost in that land. They travel together to help Mira get back home, and on the way, we get to know how to two character bond together, Yume's loneliness, Mira's desire for freedom, and how the world of dreams is crumbling away slowly.</p>
        <p>Well, years has passed and it seems the direction for this story has not changed much. Yume- I mean Lavender is still the protagonist, the world is still dying, and the plot might still revolve around loneliness. But this time, I'm not sure where I should put Mira in the story. One thing I'm sure is that she will be a crucial part of the lore, please&nbsp;<span style="font-size:0.66em">(don't)</span>&nbsp;stay tuned.</p>
        <p>( While I'm writing this, I went to take a photo of the old design of Yume/Lavender. What I'm shocked about is she did not have the cat ear thing in the first drawing, meaning I added it just because I wanted to. Please Kiwi you have countless OCs with animal ears already. )</p>

      <button class="collapsible">Red hair again ( 5 Aug 2023 )</button>
        <div class="content">
        <h1>Red hair again</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>Don't think I have ever mentioned this to anyone, but I noticed something about my top 4 favourite characters, they all have red hair.</p>
          <p>When Chigiri became one of my favourite characters, the fact he has red hair and is a speedster makes me joke to myself,"Lol of course you like a character with red hair and runs very fast you Pome fan." But at that point of time Holly is also my top fav, and that would make three of my fav having<u>&nbsp;red ( or pinkish-red at least )&nbsp;</u>color scheme and red hair. I wondered, what if the next character who becomes my fav also has red hair?</p>
          <p>The next character who enters my top blorbo list is Barou Shouei, subverting my expectations as usual, he does not have red hair. But the rule of red color is never broken, his eye color is red, and his aura color is black and red. I can still joke about how I'm only interested in red-colored characters.</p>
          <p><span style="color:#38445E;">( Hover to see spoilers:&nbsp;<span class="spoiler">Sike this is not the end of it, in the manga, it is revealed that Barou dyed his hair, and he has red streaks in his hair.&nbsp;<a style="color:#38445E;text-decoration-color:#38445E;" href="https://twitter.com/rayuga101x/status/1664435148409151488?s=12&t=gTX75ItvhsrLrdZn6VYDRA">Click here to see the pic.</a>&nbsp;That means the pattern has not broken yet, poggers!</span>&nbsp;)</span></p>
          <p>This is quite a strange phenomenon, as my favourite color is not really red ( I don't even have a particular favourite color, only a favourite color combination, which is<u>&nbsp;blue and yellow&nbsp;</u>). But if this pattern continues, it will be funny as hell.</p>

        <div class="content">
        <h1>Origin of Cosmos</h1>
          <div class="text">
          <p>If you have been checking out my posts, you might occasionally see me draw a character with gold hair and blue wings. Of course, that's none other than<u>&nbsp;Cosmos.</u></p>
	         <img src="Cosmos.png" alt="A slightly muscular woman with gold hair and blue cat ears and wings">
	         <p>You might ask: Why do you draw her so much (Or maybe you don't care but TBH, I don't care if you don't care)? Well this dates back in<u>&nbsp;15 November, 2021 ( her birthday :3 ),</u>&nbsp;when I was thinking of making a new sona, an attempt to increase my self-esteem somehow. Being shy and weak my entire life, I imagined a character who is extroverted, cheerful, and full of confidence (perhaps too much confidence lmao). I think I was basing her on<u>&nbsp;my Sky: COTL avatar, the Valley Elders, Hollyberry cookie, and Madeleine Cookie.</u></p>

          <p>At this point, she has not gotten a name, but I gave her the nickname&nbsp;<u>"Kiwy"</u>&nbsp;when I needed to refer to her somehow. A lot of changes was made to this character due to changes in my taste, lore stuff and simplifications (I do not like drawing complicated stuff). One main thing I removed is her twin tails, I liked twin tails a lot as a child, and they look very cute on my Sky Kid as well, but I eventually decided to change her hair, because the vibes didn't match well, and it IS a bit annoying drawing twin tails along with cat ears. The other aspect of her altered is her cape. I mean, wings are quite cool despite how hard it is to draw them.</p>

          <p>The first colored picture of Cosmos is in 2022 September (Though I have planned her color scheme for a long while), the colors remained quite identical to the current design aside from different clothings. I believe it is around this time I continued the slow process of building the story for Lavender and added Cosmos to the story.</p>

          <p>Few weeks before Artfight, I had just finished the first OC reference for her. All was well except she has not have a name yet. After a few googling and brainstorming, I settled on the name Cosmos. Is the name perfect for her? Not sure, but the name sounds good, and that's what matters the most.</p>
	        <p> Here's the end of this post, you may wonder what is the lore for Lavender and Cosmos? You can check out my <a href="https://stardustisle.carrd.co/">OC card</a> here. Sadly, the story-building is extremely unfinished, my story-writing skills are very weak :(. But no matter what, Cosmos is my most favourite OC, I hope I can work on her more.</p>
