Through Youtube recommendations, I saw Will Wood's The Normal Album, from the vibes I thought it would be the kind I would enjoy. And at the very first song, it caught my heart.  What I like the most about his songs is that they come in a wide variety of genres, Laplace's Angel is more villain sounding, Tomcat Disposables is more melancholic, and I don't know how to describe Suburbia Overture but there's screaming. My favourite song by Will Wood is Falling Up, which is very underrated. The melody sounds like childhood, wonderful song to play when you are having a breakdown (and yes I have done that I'm serious). I'm sure there's at least one song you will love in all of Will Wood's songs."> Will Wood channel</a>｜<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ1ctrffvMbPct8cPOJL6xQ" target="_blank" title="I first found The Crane Wives back in 2021 June from Youtube recommendations, and the song is Curses. I was looking for new songs to listen to, so I gave it a try. I found it quite nice to listen to, but it turns out 'nice' is an understatement, because I couldn't stop looping the song. Later then, I decided to listen to their other songs, and they are very banger as well! I love their songs so much (especially Curses),  listening to them while thinking about my OCs bring me so much joy.">The Crane Wives channel</a> ✧</center>
