title: Rainbow Hortensia
desc: Hydrangeas, hortensias, their color changes depending on the acidity of the soil. So I got inspired and imagined this flower. Maybe it will be quite useful for world building.

<p><mark>Rainbow Hortensia </mark>is a common flower all around Stardust Isle, it is also known for its use for indicating one's element. When one's blood is painted on an uncontaminated petal, the petal's color will change:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Energy: Red</li>
        <li>Nature: Green</li>
        <li>Water: Blue</li>
        <li>Light: Yellow</li>
        <li>Dark: Purple</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Unfortunately, I am out of these flowers at the moment, as I tend to not collect them." Lavender told the curious Cosmos, who got disappointed upon hearing the news. "Aw man, I really wanted to know what element I am..."</p>
        <p>Lavender replied, "Judging from the powers you have demonstrated before, when you shared your magic, I seemed to able to use wind-like destructive powers. My hypothesis is that you are a<mark> Energy </mark>user who can manipulate<mark> wind.</mark>"</p>
        <p>The cometling got an idea, "Oh! What if we go look for that flower? It is a common flower, isn't it?"</p>
        <p>"It's true Rainbow Hortensia is easy to find, but majority of them are not pure. If we try to find them, we might take a while to find those that are uncolored." Lavender explained, while sorting her potions and plants.</p>
        <p>Cosmos looked around, as they were currently in a dark-magic area, the flowers were mostly purple, including the hydrangeas. She grumbled, "Things would be a lot easier if I didn't lose my memories..." Before she continued to rant, she grew curious about Lavender's collection of herbs.</p>
        <p>"Hey, you seem to collect a lot of flowers and stuff, and you have used some potions in the battle just now." Cosmos asked, "Are you interested in potion making?"</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't say I love potion making, I don't have much options aside from this after all, as I cannot use magic on my own." Lavender replied, Cosmos felt a bit embarrassed for asking for such obvious answer. In the short period of silence, Cosmos drifted into thought. It would sound a bit insensitive to ask her, but she was curious about Lavender's past, what is her element? Is she magicless at birth, or did she lose her powers? Maybe she should save the questions for later, she thought.</p>
        <p>"The materials we gathered should be enough, we should move on." Lavender got up from the floor, and started walking, as Cosmos closely followed her steps.</p>
