<!--Note to self: Date is for post order, not writing date-->
<p>A retired wizard, an animal lover, a cool-headed but warm-hearted leader, an ambitious captain, and a cat-human hybrid (?), they met one another with chance, and now they travel together, uncovering mysteries of the world they live in.</p>

<p>Despite the seriousness of the situation, it wouldn’t be realistic to not have any wind-down time.</p>

<p>“DRAW 5 AGAIN?!”, the loudmouthed captain, Wolf, yelled in frustration. “Wolf is not having good luck today”, Ruth giggled, holding cards in one hand, and petting a sparrow on the other. “Well, someone has to bad end of the stick regardless.” Grey, the one who placed down the draw 5 card, gently tidied the pile of cards, slightly smiling at the situation.</p>

<p>On a cool night, the group held a card game party, it is a fun way to learn more about each other (If you don’t mind the risk of someone flipping the table).</p>

<p>Wolf grumbled as he placed down a card, “Green 7…”</p>

<p>“On the other hand, it seems we might have a winner this round.” Grey looked at Cosmos, who is holding two cards, and Lavender, who has only one. “Man, I can’t believe the one who never played UNO is so good at it.” Wolf groaned, scratching his head. “Lavender is a quick learner, a simple card game isn’t a problem!” The woman with blue cat ears patted on Lavender’s shoulder, who remained silent.</p>

<p>“However…”, Cosmos picked up a card from her hand, smirking, “Just because you are my friend, doesn’t mean I will go easy on you.” She slapped the card onto the stack of cards, causing it to fall apart. “UNO! RED 7! I bet you don’t have a red card!”</p>

<p>The ever-quiet wizard spoke up, “It’s true I do not have a red card…” Showering in victory (in Cosmos’ head), the cat-woman anticipated for Lavender to draw a card, as she pulled Lavender away from the winner’s throne-</p>

<p>“Blue 7.” Lavender placed down a card on the collpased card stack.</p>

<p>The rest of the group laughed and applauded at the final victory of Lavender, while Cosmos stood by the table, dumbfounded. Ruth broke into laughter as she tried to catch her breath, “Hahahaha! That was a great game, Lavender!”.</p>

<p>Lavender haven’t took part in group activities for so long, especially not a card game like this. However, it seems being with people isn’t as daunting as she imagined.</p>

<p>“We still have time for one more game, do you guys want to continue?” Grey collected the cards on the table, stacking them back all together. “I wanna!” Ruth exclaimed. “I will win this time!” Wolf swiftly grabbed a new set of cards. “I want a rematch!” Cosmos playfully grinned.</p>

<p>“Sure thing.” Lavender relaxed on the chair, learning to enjoy this strange game.</p>
