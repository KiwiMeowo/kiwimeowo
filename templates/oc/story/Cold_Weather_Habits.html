<p>Amidst the cold-filled forest, a purple traveller and a tall, winged adventurer walked through the dense trees. From their breaths, their heat condenses in the cold air.</p>

<p>The cat-like Cosmos shifted her ears, she glanced at Lavender, watching her breath trembled despite how much clothings she had wore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; Cosmos finally spoke up, with a slightly concerned expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo; Lavender replied monotonously.</p>

<p>Despite that reply, Cosmos couldn&rsquo;t help but looked at Lavender&rsquo;s hands. In the many days of travelling together, she had familiarised her companion&rsquo;s many habits, like how she would jot down new info into her book before sleeping, how she tapped her fingers when she&rsquo;s anxious, and how she would tuck her fingers into her palms when she feels cold, just like now.</p>

<p>Cosmos slowly went closer by Lavender&rsquo;s side, slightly opening her wings to cover her from the chilling wind. Lavender was somewhat confused by this gesture, but before she could say anything, Cosmos spoke, &ldquo;I do feel a little cold right now, so I figured maybe we should stay close together so we don&rsquo;t freeze to death!&#8230; Maybe not death, but it's still better to be warm, right?"</p>

<p>The violet traveller, being under the Cometling&rsquo; wings, felt her heat warmer than her own, maybe Cosmos was not as affected by the cold. Regardless, she did not intend to reject Cosmos’ offer. Together, they walked further to their next destination.</p>
