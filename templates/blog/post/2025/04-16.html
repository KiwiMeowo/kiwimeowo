<p>Ring Fit Adventure is a game where you exercise as you play, you beat up monsters using work out exercises. Around 2020 (I don't remember when I got the switch), this game was bundled along with the console. After setting up the accounts and stuff, we gave the game a try. Just like many people who attempts the game, I ended up being sweaty and out of breath, it was quite tiring for someone who doesn't work out regularly. Despite how painful I was, I never really gave up on the game...</p>
<p>The story of the game isn't too complex, the player accidentally unleashes Dragaux (The name is actually pronounced as Dragon in the Chinese translation) from his seal, now the ring (who was used as the seal) makes us go and stop Dragon from his evil deeds. We also meet the four masters (masters in arms, legs, stomach, and yoga). To be honest, I wasn't very attentive to the story, because I might not play the game for a long time and have gaps in my memory. I remember it wasn't very bad though.</p>
<p>What I was most interested is how I can play the games while doing exercise. One of the reasons I don't exercise very much is because it isn't very fun or rewarding, there is also not a lot of directions if you exercise on your own. To get me to be motivated in doing something, I often need to set a clear goal, like what drawings I wanna draw, or what I want to code in a webpage. For exercising? It's too vague.</p>
<p>This game is very helpful in giving me a clear goal (clear the stages) and making me feel rewarded by the game exp and coins. After adjusting the difficulty level, after defeating each monster, I was in the right level of exhaustion and satisfaction. As someone who enjoys grinding for resources while gaming, this game managed to scratch the right spot for me.</p>
<p>However, why do I have hiatuses on this game every year? For one, this game gets a bit repetitive for me. After a certain point, you'll notice the gameplay for the levels won't change a lot, nothing new happens. Even though I like repetition sometimes, I still get tired after some time. For two, I don't like people looking at me while I'm working out. Not sure if it stems from my fear of being mocked, I feel extremely awkward when someone walks into me doing exercise. I'm afraid they will say, "Oh, you are finally working out instead of being a lazy bug, huh?" or anything demeaning. So I always chooses a time when I'm sure everyone is outside, the best time for me is summer holidays.</p>
<p>I wish I can work out more, maybe I should find other efficient ways to work out. I have considered waking up early, I actually have woken up at 6 a.m. to play Ring Fit, but it is proven too difficult (eepy,,,) and I might wake up my sister anyways.</p>
<p>You might already know the benefits of exercising regularly, better health, looking fit, won't crumble apart when you get old... To be honest, one of the benefits I like the most is how my mind tends to feel clearer after I work out (I should've done that the time I dissociated but whatever). When I was in PE classes during secondary school, many classmates often complained how tired and sweaty they are, but I just felt very rejuvenated. Another thing is building muscles, while I don't think I can become as ripped as the muscular women I draw, it still feels nice to see my arm muscles becoming more defined after exercising. I joked in my head, "I should become the muscular woman I want to see so much".</p>
