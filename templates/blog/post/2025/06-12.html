<p>It&rsquo;s been a year since that coming out post I made. Over the years, I always assumed that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;normal&rdquo; (normal as in the definition by society), I didn&rsquo;t question much, always thinking I feel the same way as everyone.</p>
<p>Eventually, I realised some interesting bits through out my life, like me feeling interested in a girl when I was younger, or me being less interested in sexual topics. For a long while, I assumed those are things that everyone experiences, like the way I feel about that girl was just admiration, and people are being horny as a joke. But seeing the stories of different people, that they assumed they are straight even with the very unsubtle hints, I wanted to dig deeper.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Straightn&rsquo;t?</h2>
<p>With a bit of researching, the first clues I had was that I am bisexual. However, it didn&rsquo;t feel exactly clear to me, for many bi people, they seem to have an example of a crush of different genders. For me, while I did crush on different guys, the only example I had a crush(?) on a girl was that one time, and I&rsquo;m not even certain if that&rsquo;s actually a crush. One thing to clarify is bisexuality doesn&rsquo;t have to be 50/50, they can have a stronger attraction to a certain gender. But in my head, the definition of a crush is somewhat vague, which might be related to my next topic.</p>
<h2>Demisexual</h2>
<p>I forgot how the conversation went, but I remember my friend mentioning how I sound very ace abt something. At first, I was like &ldquo;Nah lol, I did feel sexual attraction, therefore I am not ace.&rdquo; But slowly, I started to notice how I don&rsquo;t act as horny as people on the Internet, or characters in movies. Like yea, it could&rsquo;ve been people just being more expressive on the net, or movie writer exaggerating the character&rsquo;s horniness to make the story more entertaining, but what if there&rsquo;s more to my sexuality?</p>
<p>By looking up the ace spectrum, I found something interesting. Firstly, asexuality doesn&rsquo;t just mean not feeling sexual attraction at all, some might feel attraction at certain scenarios. Secondly, I seemed to have forgotten about romantic attraction and aesthetic attraction, these three types of attraction are not the same. Anyways, I found a label that sounds quite similar to my experience:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Demisexuality is a term used to describe individuals who rarely experience primary sexual attraction – a type of attraction that is based on immediately observable characteristics such as appearance or smell, and is experienced immediately after first encounter. A demisexual person generally tends to develop sexual attraction after they experience secondary sexual attraction – a type of attraction that occurs after development of an emotional bond.<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite surprising there&rsquo;s finally a word that describes me this accurately, and it seems other demisexual (or ace in general) people often have similar experiences with me. They often dislike romance subplots for being too forced, they feel weird about one night stands, and don&rsquo;t really want to be intimate with people unless they really know them. And that actually matches my experience A LOT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me a while to actually use this label as one part of my life, well at least in my friend group. Because most of them are in the ace spectrum, I feel safe about coming out. As you might know from the coming out post last year, I sounded somewhat unsure about it, worrying if I&rsquo;m wrong and stuff. But being with other ace people makes me feel less scared about not being ace enough, like we can freely joke about sexual stuff since you don&rsquo;t have to be sex repulsed to be ace.</p>
<p>Well aside from that, learning that I&rsquo;m demisexual doesn&rsquo;t change much in my life, life simply goes on. I&rsquo;m not saying coming out is pointless, but for me, my sexuality doesn&rsquo;t impact my life a lot, at least not directly. People around me doesn&rsquo;t really ridicule others if they are being too horny or not horny enough, I don&rsquo;t think the topic of LGBTQ is being brought up a lot here. Maybe there is, and it&rsquo;s just me being too shy to be around people who talk about societal stuff. The most I see LGBTQ related stuff is online, and sometimes I see some really bigoted people harassing others, which really keeps us reminded why Pride Month exists in the first place.</p>
<p>As an ace spec person, it&rsquo;s funny and sad that some people, and maybe even LGBTQ people, don&rsquo;t think ace people&rsquo;s experiences are valid when we aren&rsquo;t doing anything, or doing anyone lol. I really wish to speak up about being ace, but getting into any sort of debate makes me freeze up like a deer in headlights, and I especially don&rsquo;t want the opponent win the debate and think &ldquo;wow those &lsquo;ace&rsquo; people must be faking their labels to seem special&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t exactly feel safe to come out in real life, I&rsquo;d probably get ridiculed, which I am already sick of. I am really thankful that I have a friend group that accepts everyone regardless of gender and sexuality, and the fact there are accepting people on the Internet as well. It is because of these people that I am not very ashamed to say what I am on the Internet, and I hope in the future, everyone can be accepted regardless of what they are and who they like.</p>
