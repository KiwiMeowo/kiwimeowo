<!--Art Discussion Dream Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>My internship has recently started, I find it quite lucky that I got to find an internship quicker than most classmates. While I was nervous at first, I was still excited to learn what work actually is outside of being told that “boss will yell at me”.</p>
<p>Now, how do I think? It actually isn’t as horrible as I thought, the collegues are cool, my intern peers seems to be nice, and so far I have not gotten in trouble yet. However, if I have to mention one thing I dislike, is that it is just so quiet here.</p>
<p>Because everyone is focusing on work, the most I would hear is the printer noises, and white noise, and maybe the occasional discussions about a project. Because the office is a professional setting, it is best to be serious and do what you gotta do, so no earphones and music.</p>
<p>It makes sense, it doesn’t sound formal to plug in earphones while the phone from other colleagues might call you. However, I realised how much I enjoy listening to song while I do my own thing. When I am drawing, writing, or just chilling on the bed, very likely I am also listening to a song or a youtuber rambling about a game I’ve never heard of. The work I am given so far is rather simple, but whenever I input data into spreadsheets, I really wished I can just listen to my playlist at the same time.</p>
<p>I think what’s worse is when I am out of things to do. Sometimes I finish the work I’m given, then my mentor would say there is nothing for me at the moment. So I would have to sit on my chair all day doing nothing, or maybe do reports (which there is not a lot to write about now). While I can scroll my phone and play games, I feel very bad like, what if someone very high up comes and see me, who has done everything, “slacking off”? So the best thing I could do is pretend I am working (staring at the spreadsheet documents), or just space out.</p>
<p>So after work, I learnt to enjoy listening to music more than I already have. Whenever I am free, I would quickly plug in my earphones and listen to the songs I want to listen to for so long. It feels like the songs sound extra beautiful recently, it’s sad there’s less than 8 hours of free time now.</p>
<p>I hope the internship will go well, and I don’t go insane.</p>
