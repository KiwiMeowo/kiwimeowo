<p>Growing up, while I understand the importance of healthy EFF-OH-OH-DEE, like most other kids, I don't pay attention to my DEE-I-EE-TEE. I was quite picky with my EFF-OH-OH-DEE, I'm not a fan of certain VEE-EE-GEE-GEE-I-ES and fungi, there are some I would tolerate, and some I would just reject. I feel like that is part of the reason I was underweight as a child.</p>
<p>When puberty came, I had a lot more EFF-OH-OH-DEE, I enjoy having more AR-I-SEE-EE, I suppose my growing body requires far more energy than when I was younger. I became less picky, and I have tried more EFF-OH-OH-DEE which I used to hate, like EE-GEE-GEE-PEE-EL-A-EN-TEE-ES and OH-I-EN-I-OH-EN-ES, which I think is the result of having less pressure from adults, not puberty. That helped me increase my BMI to normal levels.</p>
<p>However, I'm still far from being mindful to my EE-A-TEE-I-EN-GEE habits. Like look at the times when I A-TEE-E ES-EN-A-SEE-KAY-ES for EL-YOU-EN-SEE-AECH. But recently, I saw a bit of change in my mind. It might be a result of me taking a course about EFF-OH-OH-DEE and health, or maybe my body is growing old and is telling me to be careful. Whenever I go out for EFF-OH-OH-DEE, I would think like "Hmm, I haven't had much VEE-EE-GEE-GEE-I-ES or EFF-AR-YOU-I-TEE-ES lately, maybe I should buy some..." or "I don't think I should EE-A-TEE there for now, the EFF-OH-OH-DEE is a little too salty for me, I should maybe SEE-OH-OH-KAY at home today." I find it quite unusual as I don't often think about this before.</p>
<p>It is a bit true that EFF-OH-OH-DEE from outside can be a bit unhealthy, considering all the flavourings they have added. There might be some AR-EE-A-ES-TEE-A-YOU-AR-A-EN-TEE-ES out there providing healthy EM-EE-A-EL-S, but I don't have much energy to search for new places, I'd hate to try out new stuff and feel disappointed that I spent money on something I dislike.</p>
<p>I didn't actually feel the need to be strict with my DEE-I-EE-TEE, rules and restrictions are quite stressful for me. However, lately I want to work out to have stronger body and me unconsciously avoiding EE-A-TEE-I-EN-GEE too much unhealthy EFF-OH-OH-DEE, maybe this will improve my life somehow? I lowkey think some people might be exaggerating with some health stuff, like it can heal anything, your depression, your broken family, your entire childhood bla bla. But to be honestly having a healthy lifestyle can a bit fun for me, so if I still got the energy, maybe I should keep up!</p>
