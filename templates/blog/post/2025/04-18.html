<p>Growing up, while I understand the importance of healthy <span class="food">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span>, like most other kids, I don't pay attention to my <span class="food">DEE-IYE-EE-TEE</span>. I was quite picky with my <span class="food">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span>, I'm not a fan of certain <span class="food">VEE-EE-GEE-GEE-IYE-EE-ES</span> and fungi, there are some I would tolerate, and some I would just reject. I feel like that is part of the reason I was underweight as a child.</p>
<p>When puberty came, I had a lot more <span class="food">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span>, I enjoy having more <span class="food">AR-IYE-SEE-EE</span>, I suppose my growing body requires far more energy than when I was younger. I became less picky, and I have tried more <span class="food">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span> which I used to hate, like <span class="food">EE-GEE-GEE-PEE-EL-AY-EN-TEE-ES</span> and <span class="food">OH-EN-IYE-OH-EN-ES</span>, which I think is the result of having less pressure from adults, not puberty. That helped me increase my BMI to normal levels.</p>
<p>However, I'm still far from being mindful to my <span class="food">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span> habits. Like look at the times when I <span class="food">AY-TEE-EE ES-EN-AY-SEE-KAY-ES</span> for <span class="food">EL-YOU-EN-SEE-AECH</span> . But recently, I saw a bit of change in my mind. It might be a result of me taking a course about <span class="food">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span> and health, or maybe my body is growing old and is telling me to be careful. Whenever I go out for <span class="food">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span>, I would think like "Hmm, I haven't had much <span class="food">VEE-EE-GEE-GEE-IYE-EE-ES</span> or <span class="food">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span> lately, maybe I should buy some..." or "I don't think I should <span class="food">EE-AY-TEE</span> there for now, the <span class="food">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span> is a little too salty for me, I should maybe <span class="food">SEE-OH-OH-KAY</span> at home today." I find it quite unusual as I don't often think about this before.</p>
<p>It is a bit true that <span class="food">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span> from outside can be a bit unhealthy, considering all the flavourings they have added. There might be some <span class="food">AR-EE-ES-TEE-AY-YOU-AR-AY-EN-TEE-ES</span> out there providing healthy <span class="food">EM-EE-AY-EL-S</span>, but I don't have much energy to search for new places, I'd hate to try out new stuff and feel disappointed that I spent money on something I dislike.</p>
<p>I didn't actually feel the need to be strict with my <span class="food">DEE-IYE-EE-TEE</span>, rules and restrictions are quite stressful for me. However, lately I want to work out to have stronger body and me unconsciously avoiding <span class="food">EE-AY-TEE-IYE-EN-GEE</span> too much unhealthy <span class="food">EFF-OH-OH-DEE</span>, maybe this will improve my life somehow? I lowkey think some people might be exaggerating with some health stuff, like it can heal anything, your depression, your broken family, your entire childhood bla bla. But to be honestly having a healthy lifestyle can a bit fun for me, so if I still got the energy, maybe I should keep up!</p>
