<p>From the previous blog, I talked about some old IOS games I played as a kid. And after writing the blog, I decided to try out PetWorld again, despite how disappointed I am by the AI icon. I mean, as a kid I played hours of it, perhaps I would still enjoy playing it.</p>
<p>The gameplay is simple, every day, you take care of the animals at the shelter, feed them, brush them, pet them. And when a adopter comes, you give them an animal that matches their requirements. The starter animals are hamsters, rabbits and guinea pigs, you have to spend coins or real money for dogs and cats, so the icon is a bit misleading.</p>
<p>While the style of the game feels the same as before, there is a mechanic that isn't present anymore. Back then, when you need to get pet food and other materials, you have to go to the storage room and grab the stuff for different animals. You also have to dispose the beddings at the trash can. However, this mechanic is gone, despite the professor at the adoptiong centre mentioning the storage room and trash can. This change might be good though, as the game gets very annoying to play.</p>
<p>This game gets VERY repetitive, and there's basically no new stuff after you finish the tutorial. It is just take care of animals, get them adopted, then day restarts, repeat. I don't very mind dogs and cats needing 300 coins each, it takes around 20 days to earn that much money, which isn't a lot in my opinion. I just wish this game has more unique events.</p>
<p>However, I enjoy repetitive games to a certain degree. I like letting my brain relax and do simple stuff to see the money counter go up. After I played it for an hour and thought I got bored of it, it only took me an hour to open that game again. To be honest, doing a task over and over again is better than being yelled at by a customer because I forgot to add pesto sauce /ref</p>
<p>I still yet to find the perfect mobile game to play during train rides, GPGP or GCGC is fun but I hate how harsh the customers are sometimes, this game is relaxing to play but I can imagine I'll get bored of it very soon. I hope someday I will find a game that just hits the perfect spot for me to play it for a long time.</p>
