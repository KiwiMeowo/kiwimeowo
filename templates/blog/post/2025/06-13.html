<p>As you know, internship is occupying a major amount of my time, so there isn’t a lot of free time to draw much now. However, nothing is stopping me from celebrating Ruth’s birthday!</p>
<p>Looking at my previous Ruth birthday blog, it can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ruth’s beta design concepts and changes</li>
    <li>She isn’t as depressed as others</li>
    <li>Her character is made to be the beacon of joy</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite me worrying having nothing to mention for my OCs birthdays, I’m glad to say I have new stuff planning for Ruth!</p>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning, as you know, Ruth is raised by animals in the forest. Because of that, she has a deep connection with animals, and she seems to feel the closest with foxes. Her wish is to be a really cool magical girl, like the ones in her favourite picture books. </p>
<p>I kinda forgot why I made her ability to be animal related, maybe because her old design was a fox girl? Anyways, I think this story concept is quite interesting, but because of my limited creativity, I initially don’t know how to expand from there. I could make her backstory extremely simple, but I think there’s some untapped potential. And more importantly, there is some plot holes, like how did Ruth get her name, how did she learn to speak, where did she get her clothes?</p>
<p>One thing I have been thinking of regarding Ruth’s backstory is the animals. While around her, the animals are docile, and won’t do anything that hurts her, how does it affect the food chain? While I imagine the animals won’t fight each other around her, carnivores cannot stop eating meat, or else they’ll starve. It might be possible that animals will devour others when Ruth isn’t near, but I don’t think her illusion of peace will last very long.</p>
<p>What’s more difficult to hide from her is death. Compared to humans, animals in the wild don’t live very long with how unpredictable the lands are. She might have grew up with many animals, but perhaps some of them will have passed away very soon, maybe due to old age, maybe due to unseen circumstances. Despite being the happy young child, she might have witnessed more deaths of close ones than others in the main team. If the main team saw someone dying, surprisingly, Ruth may be the calmest.</p>
<p>Although Ruth was not found by humans when she was born into the world, it is quite difficult if nobody actually noticed her in some point in her life. A clan, similar to Solar’s clan Luminescence, might have found her. However, the clan didn’t let her in, maybe due to her powers not being strong enough, maybe they don’t have enough resources to take care another child. Regardless, she was not permitted inside the area… </p>
<p>Strangely, someone else in the clan wanted her to stay. While the person couldn’t find a way to stay inside their room, they got to talk to her, though she didn’t know how to speak to a human at that time. Not understanding what the person is saying, she woofed in confusion (ruff?), this sounds dumb but this is where her name came from. With the person taking care of Ruth by giving out food, clothing and books from the window, Ruth learnt more about humans, and the story of a powerful magic wielder.</p>
<p>Eventually, Ruth wished to cast magic like the magical girl from the storybooks… Somehow, not only did she not know all the people in Stardust Isle can cast magic, she also never realised she can use magic, as she interpreted that everyone can communicate with animals like she can. But even after knowing everyone can use magic, she often worried her magic isn’t enough to protect the ones she care about.</p>
<p>I think this story can be written as a fic, it will have more emotional impact this way. With most of the ideas written down, I realised how much potential Ruth’s story has. I thought I didn’t have much progress in writing the story, but it seems I have accumulated many ideas in my head!</p>
<p>Here's the birthday art, it took a while but I did it!</p>
