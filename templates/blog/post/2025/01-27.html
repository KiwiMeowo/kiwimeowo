<p>Recently, I came across a video name <a href="https://youtu.be/DhXTpgx99_k?si=vllPVkvhlPrXoMrl" target="_blank">Prince Care Guide</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@quiietjay" target="_blank">QuiietJay</a>. The thumbnail looks cool, and I assumed it is a video about a fictional creature (which it is), so my curiosity clicked into it.</p>
<p>Judging by its appearance and description, the Prince is based off Prince Rupert drops, they are glass drops that are strong on the head, but fragile at the tail, the entire thing shatters if the tail is broken. It is quite an interesting creature design.</p>
<p>But what surprised me the most is the format of the series. Despite it is in an analog style, it doesn't not go in the horror approach. I was bracing for some scary twist or jumpscares, but the worst thing that happened was a Prince shattering after a wooden plank happened to fall down onto it D:. But to my surprise, when a Prince is shattered, it transforms into a Queen, a ethereal, glowing creature. The video (and the other videos in the series) ends in a light-hearted matter.</p>
<p>What I really love how this series is how light-hearted it feels. The Zooliminology Project has very little budget, unlike other fictional organisations like SCP, which has a lot of resources, this team couldn't buy many cement blocks before their budget starts to strain. Because of that, the styles of the videos feels very human and approachable. I also like how the crew doesn't speak with a serious attitude a lot of the times, like in the <a href="https://youtu.be/qo3KZ9ZUqgU?si=QHuSuF4ZfMdLGORV" target="_blank">Longlegs video</a>, they showed a footage of a Longlegs simulation, and the crew broke into laughter after the 3D model broke into pieces.</p>
<p>This series is fairly new, and there are less than five videos for the time being. But I would love to continue following this series, I really enjoy this style.</p>
