<!--Art Discussion Dream Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>Do you ever see very strange visions right before you fall into sleep? Apparently these are called hypnagogic hallucinations, which is a normal phenonmenon. But man aren't these disturbing sometimes, the visions sometimes give me trypophobia I thought I didn't have!</p>
<p>However, this isn't what I want to take about. I sometimes have dreams that are similar to hypnagogic hallucinations, but those occur during sleep, and they are so brain power consuming, they can wake me up. I can't find any good results from Google Search, so I might just have to speak purely from experience.</p>
<p>While these dreams aren't common, but when they happen, they are extremely annoying. The dreams doesn't show any events, not daily activities in life, nor cool adventures flying in the sky, the vision in front of you is dark, and kinda abstract. To describe the feeling, it is like your brain decided to turn your mind into a different file format, even though the brain can't handle said format.</p>
<p>There is one dream that made my mind into a csv like format, all the thoughts are organised into cells, and I have to organise them... What does that even mean?? I was like Sisyphus pushing a spherical boulder on top of the hill, the cells keep getting messy, it's impossible to clean them up!</p>
<p>There is another dream I had today, that I have to manage two minds at once. This might be influenced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjpHzNtD_bk" target="_blank">the It Takes Two videos by JaidenAnimations and AlphaRad</a>(The videos are very funny by the way), which involves the POV of two people. As you can imagine, having to handle the brain power equivilent of two people is difficult.</p>
<p>So everytime I have these types of dreams, I always feel extremely groggy. These dreams are so tiring, I actually become half-awake, and I would desperately try to fall back into sleep, which I would fail. I would have to pray these visions will go away at some point, sadly these take quite a long time to fade.</p>
<p>The worst part of this is that these dreams aren't even entertaining! I have had dreams that consumes a lot of my brain power, but at least those are still fun to some degree. But the dreams I just mentioned are just me trying to organise abstract concepts of imaginary objects. Damn at least show me something meaningful.</p>
<p>I remember I wishing that I have more dreams, I guess there's a monkey's paw which heard me.</p>
