<!--Art Discussion Dream Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>Lately, my mood isn't very well. My mind is quite sensitive, if a story I'm reading has something that is a little too disturbing to be, my mental state can deteriorate very quickly. I'm feeling a bit better, but I feel kinda disorientated.</p>
<p>My Discord friends watched Knights of Guinevere, and seems to enjoy it quite a lot. Like my reactions to many popular shows, I don't have an immediate urge to watch it, I don't really want to spend time on something that might not be my cup of tea, what if that show contains something I found disturbing? However, apparently my sister watched it as well. She said that there are too many unsolved plot points, so she can't say the show is good or bad yet. Her opinion on this show seems to have encouraged me to try it out, and guess what? I don't regret watching it, I really enjoyed it!</p>
<hr>
<p>The show takes place in a distopian world, in a long time ago, Park Planet was established, a gift from Olivia's father to her. Apparently it was for Olivia to move on from a past, which is not elaborated in the story. Olivia seems to also have an obsession with fixing her android Guinevere, but her method of 'fixing' caused a lot of suffering for Guin, and Guin tried to escape due to this (perhaps multiple times through out the past).</p>
<p>The story revolves around Francesca and Andrea, the two met Guinevere. Frankie is very fond of Park Planet and Guinevere, and really wants to work in Park Planet. Andrea on the other hand, has a less ideal impression of the place since she was working there and was very overworked. With coincidence, they met a very worn-down Guinevere android, which model they had never seen before. Frankie, who wanted to impress Park Planet by fixing the Guinevere, and Andi, who wanted to earn lots of money by fixing it, they set out to find the repair halo, facing many obstacles.</p>
<hr>
<p>After watching the video, actually just in the beginning of the video, it is obvious this show is poking fun at Disney. While Park Planet looks magical and pretty on the surface, it does a lot of morally-dubious actions and may be hiding a lot of dark secrets behind its mask. While we haven't know the full story behind that theme park, the fact the people living in M-7 hated Park Planet, the theme park island throwing trash to the ocean, Andi given an unreasonable amount of work, and there is a robot that is implied to have organic blood, really gets the audience wonder how much evil things this corporation has done.</p>
<p>I also really love how the show made fun of Disneys making lots of live-action remakes of older well-loved stories to earn easy money, even when a lot of people didn't really want it. There is a moment showing a live-action of a new Guinevere show, saying "The princess can save herself". And the comments feel exactly like what you would expect in a real-life scenario, people calling it woke, comments mocking how they never asked for it, and many saying the series has fallen from its prime. Another thing I found funny was in the poster for Washed Up, Guinevere's expression looks exactly like that dumb face Elsa makes in the Frozen poster.</p>
<p>The details and the background of this show are very well-made, after my first watch, I had to rewatch it a bit and look at any details I missed. There are many easter eggs, like the crane machine having plushies of characters from the other shows in Glitch, the blackboard counting the times Andi and Frankie did the dishes (and Frankie saying sorry for not washing the dishes enough), and sometimes there will be links for you to access. Like in this screenshot, there is a link and it works! You really show go check it out!</p>

<p>As for the characters, I really love how the characters are not exactly right or wrong. Frankie and Andi are very motivated to fix Guinevere, but mainly not because they felt bad for the android, it is for for their own profit. Frankie wants to work in Park Planet, and Andi wants to earn money after being fired. Sparky, who is Frankie's boss, is very against fixing Guin, it is better to sell her for scraps than helping Park Planet. While the protagonists are usually in the right position, Frankie and Andrea current stance seems to help Park Planet more, which makes Sparky's opinion quite valid, like why would you want to have anything to do with a big evil corp?</p>
<p>Frankie seems to represent the people who have an deep admiration with the companies which created their childhood. While I don't particularly have a great attachment to Disney, I used to feel Disney was a beatiful place for creation and art, a perfect land for people with dreams. Frankie's imagination can be very vivd, she interacts with her little robots like fairies, and has little imaginary friends that she talks to. However, she sometimes slips too deep into her imagination, I feel like it is more suitable to call it hallucination? Her mind doesn't come back to reality even after Andi came back, this sounds a bit concerning.</p>

<p>Andi seems like the people who have learnt that the companies that seem so wonderful is in fact, not that great. Disney has exploited the employees and the actors, some are even just children. Even if you are out-of-touch with the things Disney did, it isn't hard to tell the movies they make aren't as great as before, are there people who even like Wish? While Andi's job might seem cool, she is extremely stressed out by the workload, and she was fired for a reason not  explained in our POV. What I really like about Andi is she isn't afraid to bite back if you insult her. Because the town really dislikes Park Planet, Andi wasn't well-liked as well due to her work. But a guy spits on her for working in Park Planet, she turns back and confronts him immediately instead of sulking from the shame. Man I admire her.</p>
<p>We don't know much about the Guinevere they found, since she spent most of the time being broken. There is a moment where she comes in to protect the two from a giant robot, in Guin's view, it seems she always sees the two as young children, and she comforted Frankie like she is trying to protect a child from a dangerous person. She stands in front of the robot while Frankie and Andi hides in the elevator, the door closing as we see Guin looking back like a hero sacrificing herself in the battle... Except she won??!??? Aside from the shock Guin may be far stronger than we thought, I also felt very emotional how gentle and protecting Guin is during that scene. Thank god she is ok, actually, if anything bad happens to the three of them, I'm killing everyone and myself /ref</p>

<p>This is just a pilot right now, it will need more support in order to make this show actually a series. I really recommend watching this, the art is pretty and the story is so interesting.</p>
