<p>So today is my birthday, nothing eventful really, because I kinda spent the day alone. My family is all unavailible, especially my sister went to Australia today. It's nice we managed to eat the pistachio birthday cake before her departure though, she also helped me buy the tasty cheese cake bun thing from Châteraisé, my sister said it isn't her cup of tea, but I love it.</p>

<p>It is kinda a bummer she couldn't celebrate my birthday the whole day, but I didn't mind very much as she already gifted me a lot of stuff, like the cake, the cheese bun, and headphones.</p>

<p>Nothing special happened today, I just spent the whole day drawing and gaming and chilling. So I think I should instead talk about something else, like feeling like I'm still a teen. While I don't remember if I mentioned this, but I often felt like I'm stuck in the year of 2018 mentally, pretty sure COVID made my time vision flow weirder. There's also a thing how growing older doesn't mean feeling older, and when I had to reorganise my mental state, I might not feel as present as others, I still feel like I slip away from reality more than I should or want.</p>
<p>But recently, I feel... slightly older, I actually feel like my age. Being a new adult doesn't automatically mean you understand how to do everything, I think it takes a bit longer, maybe in the 30s, that people would start understand how to be a mature human. And currently, I feel like I'm starting to feel like I'm getting myself together, albeit still recovering from my trauma. So I hope I stay this way.</p>
<p>Kinda a short blog, so for this birthday wish, I wish to hang out with my friend again.</p>
