<!--Art Discussion Dream Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>Back in 2023, I have discussed my irrational fears, like teeth falling out, wet floors, and machines, but I will be focusing on the last one in this blog.</p>
<p>It is somewhat a common fear of humans to be scared of machines, they can do a lot for us, but they can also kill us in an instant if they want to. When it does something it normally doesn't or makes strange noises, this always makes people jump. I do have this kind of fear, especially those with a number display.</p>
<p>The first example is the water heater in my home, it is installed in a way that it is always in front of our faces when we shower. As long as I could remember, I disliked the water heater, it just looks... unnerving? When I turn on the water heater, a number indicating the water temperature is shown. It is usually set to a certain temperature (which changes depending on the season), and it feels very strange when the number is changed. The irrational fear that is in the back of my head is that the number would randomly go up or down to unreasonable amounts, like it won't happen realistically, but it's a scary thought. Apparently when you set the heater a temperature too high or low, the display would start blinking. When I found out about this, I was quite disturbed. The heater won't explode in my face, right?</p>
<p>Another related fear is elevators. While it is a convenient form of transport to higher floors, it is also a confined room which can kill you when it malfunctions. In my many years of living, I have yet to be in a malfunctioning elevator, but the fear is still strong. I often have dreams being in elevators going to floors that should not be possible, like floor numbers higher than the top floor in the building, or negative floor numbers (which usually don't exist in buildings I've been to). There is at least one dream that resulted in me dying in a falling elevator.</p>
<p>Honestly why are error screens in electronic devices so scary? I don't encounter error screens a lot, but there is one error screen that scares me the most. I used to go to Jumping Gym (Casino but for kids) as a kid, one time I saw a mulfunctioning arcade machine (or in maintenance?), and the screen was blue with some sort of timer, it was also making some ominous sound, I lowkey thought it was gonna explode. That contributed to my fear of malfunctioning machines a bit, and I shortly had a dream of my DS having an error screen and was about to explode.</p>
<p>Idk how to conclude this blog, elevators scary</p>
