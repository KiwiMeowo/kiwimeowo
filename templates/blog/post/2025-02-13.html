<p>Growing up, I noticed plenty of adults likes drinking alcohol for some reason. Despite how people described it to be bitter and harsh on the mouth, they often continue to drink it, and I never really know why they like it so much.</p>
<p>I had alcohol multiples times, less than 10 cups I think. One of those times are during my childhood, when I mistook rice wine for water during a trip of Korea. It was extremely bitter, I was quite disgusted. The next time I had another cup of alcohol is during Orientation Night, where university students hang out and stuff. In my point of view, beer taste like rotten orange juice, it was so bitter I couldn't take more than a small sip each time. The people there said my alcohol tolerance isn't quite good, but I think I just ingested it very slowly and I actually only took a little amount. I also had fruit soju, which taste just like fruit juice, and taste quite nice with yakult. But honestly, the taste feels just like juice I'd rather just drink normal juice at that point.</p>
<p>If alcohol taste so bad, then why do people like it so much? That is a question I often have through out my life. I have heard some answers somewhere from the internet, and I never forgot it because of how ridiculous it is from my point of view: "𝓑𝓮𝓬𝓪𝓾𝓼𝓮 𝓪𝓵𝓬𝓸𝓱𝓸𝓵 𝓲𝓼 𝓵𝓮𝓼𝓼 𝓫𝓲𝓽𝓽𝓮𝓻 𝓽𝓱𝓪𝓷 𝓵𝓲𝓯𝓮". My answer to that is, guess what taste less bitter than both alcohol and life? CHOCOLATE. I don't know if the people are just being 'poetic' or I'm missing a deeper meaning.</p>
<p>Side topic though, I lowkey think I'm eating too much chocolate to cope with my awful mental state these few months. I really like the ones that are very sweet, it scratches my mind, makes me feel better. I'm not sure if it is benefical to my physical health though...</p>
<p>Ok back to alcohol. Another response people gave was that alcohol numbs their minds. Because alcohol makes people drunk, they often forgets their worries and pain, and just let their minds sink into whatever happens next. Knowing that, it makes me wonder how being drunk feels. With the few times I've drunk alcohol before, I always consume a reasonable amount because it isn't exactly safe to be drunk there. But I lowkey wish I know how being drunk feels, just to maybe experience something cool. I kind of worry what drunk me would do though, I heard some people become very violent under alcohol.</p>
<p>I've been thinking to buy alcohol for myself to get drunk, but I don't feel like spending money to buy a drink that I don't like. Soju taste pretty nice, but I heard the alcohol content is pretty low, is one bottle enough for an average person is get drunk? For now I'll just stick to lemon tea and other sweet drinks.</p>
