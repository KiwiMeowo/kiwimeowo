<p>Today I received a notification that Good Coffee, Great Coffee (GCGC) is out in App Store. This is a game made by the same people who made GPGP, I was quite surprised when I learnt they made a spinoff game. However, I didn't expect much since it feels like the gameplay would be very similar to GPGP.</p>
<p>However, the gameplay is quite interesting and varied. In GPGP, the steps of making a pizza is simple, you prepare the dough, spread out the sauce, cheese and toppings, bake it once or twice, cut it and done. In GCGC, depending on the type of drink, you might have to do very different things. To brew an espresso, you get the grinded coffe beans, stamp it and extract it. If it's a latte (isn't latte just milk?), you need to steam the milk and add to the coffee. If it's iced coffee, add two scoops of ice before hand. For flavour extracts, 4 pumps. And sometimes if you put one ingredient before the other, it fucks up the order.</p>
<p>The game is very brain-cell-consuming, like my head hurts right now, probably the fact I drank coffee beforehand doesn't help. With so many recipes having specific steps, I have to pay attention to which part of the step I'm doing. Moreover, each steps have weird timings, so multi-tasking is extremely difficult. There are times I try to prepare a cup with ice and flavourings while the espresso is being extracted, only to see I was a bit too late and the espresso is over-extracted. And if I just stand there and watch the extraction, it feels like I'm wasting time.</p>
<p>But is it fun though? Yes. It is a refreshing experience after playing GPGP for a while. Also some of the orders here are very funny, why would you go to a coffee shop to buy water?? Moreover, you can draw latte art, it is quite difficult to draw something more complex than Cosmos' face, but it is nice to provide a space for doing something creative. </p>
<p>One sad thing about this game is that it has a stamina system, you have to wait for it to recharge if you spent all of it. It might be good for me, who will waste 12 hours of my time being addicted to it, but it is frustrating that I can't freely play it whenever I want.</p>
<p>At the time being, all the stamina is spent, so I will do something else more productive. I'd recommend playing this game, it's fun to play, though it hurts my head ★★★★★ ★★☆☆☆</p>
