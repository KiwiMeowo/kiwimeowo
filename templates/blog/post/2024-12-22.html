<p>I don't consider myself to be a very festive person, especially after I grew up when my family has less time and energy to decorate houses. During Lunar New Year (which is biggest festival here IMO), we just go to grandma's house, but at home there aren't much decoration, not as much as years ago where we would place a candy box.</p>
<p>But if I had more energy and time, I would love to celebrate festivals even harder, like drawing festive art for example, I did that <a href="/art/val2024.html">this Valentines day (a whole album!)</a> and last Halloween. But that still didn't surprise me about how hard people were celebrating Halloween on the Internet.</p>
<p>Hong Kong isn't exactly a place that celebrates Halloween much, not sure why. My neighbours don't place pumpkins or lanterns that day, and I don't know how acceptable it is to just walk around apartment complexes. Also, I studied in a Christian school (which I may have mentioned?), so they never celebrated Halloween. My kindergarten and secondary school aren't Christian, but neither experiences were that great, bullies flipped my skirt on Trick-or-Treat in kindergarten. As for the other experience, I wouldn't say it's bad, it's just underwhelming, and my acquaintances thought I was scared, when it was that something was in my way.</p>
<p>Knowing that I don't bother with Halloween a lot, you can imagine my surprise when I see basically everyone talking about Halloween, like Trick-or-Treating, wearing cool costumes, going to party and stuff... I was kind of jealous, like man I wanna wear a cat costume and eat a bunch of candy. But where can I even do that? The only thing I can do is buy many candies myself, yum.</p>
<p>While in real life, it might be difficult for me to plan anything for festivals, but at least I have this website, where I can decorate as hard as I want to. Maybe I should try this on Chrismas, if I have the motivation to.</p>
