<!--Art Discussion Dream Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>So one of my friends really like the game Mindhack, didn't know what game that was, and I often have a hard time starting a new story cuz you know, want to avoid anything destructive to my mental health. However, recently I was very bored, and I don't mind spending a bit more on games. So when he mentioned Mindhack again in the Discord server, I was like "yea I should try it out".</p>
<p>Mindhack is a visual movel, where you play as a doctor/mindhacker who can remove BUGs (the thing that makes people destructive and violent) and alter the minds of evildoers into kind saints. With the short description, you might already think "Wait is this ethical?", and if that is the case, that is my thought the whole time I was playing this game, and the events just escalates worse and worse.</p>
<p>I will use chapter 1/demo chapter as an example, but I will hide the more story parts in case you want to experience the game yourself. <span class="spoiler">Unid was a gang leader who caused a fire in a neighbourhood and caused a person's death, he was taken in the Mindhack facility to be treated by the Doctor, a.k.a. the one we are playing as.</span> During the Mindhacking session, it feels somewhat like a therapy session, diving into the patient's past and struggles. <span class="spoiler">However, what makes Mindhacking different is the way it changes the patient's mind, it directly wipes away any memories and traits that makes the person prone to BUGs. When the procedure finishes, the person's personality may drastically change. Unid, who was violent and angry at the start, becomes a friendly guy who acts chill to everyone.</span> Mindhacking feels more like brainwashing, this method of altering the minds of evildoers feels very unethical, yea sure it might be benefical to the society that it removed potential criminals out of the picture, but the fact the evildoers' personalities were changed forcefully instead of a slow improvement from outside influences, it just feels wrong. However, it seems everyone around the Doctor doesn't really care about the ethics, and only think mindhacking is an amazing and helpful technology, perhaps after seeing the benefits of mindhacking the downsides are very minimal to them.</p>
<p>Aside from making players think about the ethics, it won't be the only thing player will have to deal with. <span class="spoiler">At the end of the first chapter, it is apparent that Doctor also has destructive impluses, perhaps even a BUG in their mind, though nobody has pointed this out yet. So in later chapters, we will see Doctor dealing with their own destructive acts during their work, even when Mindhacking, causing a bit of problem. However, FORMAT, the AI who detects BUGs in people and acts like a mother to Doctor, not only don't mind the sudden change of Doctor's demeanor, they actively encourages their behavior.</span> So in every chapter, I just went "Oh, oh no, oh no oh no...". During the story I sometimes just wish I can stop Doctor from doing whatever they are doing.</p>
<p>The style of the game is very cool, the mindhacking process is often decorated with flowers, the things Doctor like the most <span class="spoiler">and likes to destroy</span>. When the flowers cover the patients, it feels as if the flowers are ethreal and unreal compared to everything else, quite beautiful I must say. I also find the character designs very interesting, the characters range from humanoid and anthro (Is Unid an objecthead character or anthro?), but even the humanoid characters often have their faces obscured. Captain's face is obscured by shadow of their hood, with a white circle shining within the shadow, resembling a lens of a glasses. Rookie looks humanoid but we haven't seen his face without the helmet. I think there is a humanoid character with a face, but their style looks very stickman-like. As for Doctor, we never saw what they looked like, we only know they at least have a mouth.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the characters. While we play as the Doctor, we doesn't know a lot about what they happened in the past. It is clear that Doctor sticks to their schedules very strictly (eating bread for breakfast for many years), and they always obey FORMAT. There are various choices when interacting with characters, but when FORMAT orders Doctor to do something, despite the screen prompting the player to choose a dialog, there is only one choice, which is "Yes, FORMAT". I also really like the pair of gloves is the only part we can see from Doctor, we can't see their expression, but the movement of the hands can show a lot. For some reason, Doctor really likes to do this pose 👉 👈, it's very adorable.</p>
<p>I also really like the Captain. Commonly, leaders, captains and something similar tend to act cold, and maybe show their kinder, warmer side sometimes, which is very cute. However, Captain shows their friendly personality a lot, even to the soldiers and past BUG havers. They aren't cheery or happy-go-lucky, but they aren't the type to take things seriously 24/7, <span class="spoiler">I mean they responded the idea of humans having 5 butts with "It will be a pain to have 10 legs", though I think the minimum amount of legs to have 5 butts is 6, and maybe 5 if you make the human body look more grotesque</span>. Their caring personality contrasting with their appearance, like ough my heart.</p>
<p>Part about the patients: <span class="spoiler">Unid became very friendly after the mindhack, he makes a lot of stupid statements, but he might already be stupid long ago. Despite how silly he acts, I always think about how he became like this, and I always feel bad even though it feels like it is better for him and everyone. Ivrig's sprites are very expressive and fun, goofy guy, what a tragedy he came to the facility after Doctor started the destructive acts. Before I played this game, seeing Ivrig made me assume he was an objecthead character, however, it turns out he is supposed to be an anthro character looking like a fusion of arctic fox and goat/deer? Because he was so passionate over the cult he was in, he decided to wield a metal cabinet over his head (not required by the cult I believe). Man Ivrig's story is quite rough...</span></p>
<hr>
<p>I don't introduce games with dark elements, and I was wary at first that it might contain a lot of stuff I am sensitive about. Luckily, I felt fine after playing this game, it's still fucked up, but my mental state didn't get crumbled like Ousana Ranking did *squints*. Each chapter doesn't take very long to go through unless you want to collect all options and extras, the gameplay is quite simple as well, you just need to type words. The content warnings and descriptions are listed in the Steam page, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1727210/MINDHACK/" target="_blank">you can go check the game out</a>!</p>
<center><h2>Rating: ★★★★☆</h2><br><p>Please don't let anything bad happen to Captain and Rookie...</p></center>
