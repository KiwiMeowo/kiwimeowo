<p>I play mobile games, which isn't new anyhow. As a long-time Cookie Run player, I spent many hours grinding, to the level some people may consider competitive. I don't see myself as a hardcore player, I just have a bit of perfectionism that's all. However, no matter which Cookie Run game I'm playing, one of my major pet peeve is how many things can be going on in the background.</p>
<p>One annoying thing is the notifications dots being EVERYWHERE. Today I decided to revisit Ovenbreak, which I haven't touched since Black Swan update. There are so many game modes and events, and the red dots are in every single spot. Lobby design, gacha button, events, returning player events, bla bla bla. It takes forever to check them all. One thing CROB likes to do is putting small rewards in the updates board, there are multiple slides for each update section, so you have to slide, and click, multiple times. Can't I just... not look at them, at all?</p>
<p>Two, there are so many game modes. While it is quite normal for games to have many events to keep players engaged, there are more and more game modes each event, it is very difficult to catch up. Recently, Cookie Run Kingdom has so many game modes in one update, Cake Shop, Error Busters (which is the most time-consuming game mode), the one you beat monster levels with your cookie avatar, I actually do not have the energy nor time to play them all.</p>
<p>Three, the game always change some important mechanic that affects the resources of the players, usually for the worse. Like every year or so, Cookie Run Kingdom increases the max level by 10, remember when it used to be level 60? Now the max level is 90. The cookies didn't have ascension when the game first released, so you only have to deal with 5 stars max. </p>
<p>Although the things mentioned above are all ways to make players keep playing, but what's the most annoying is for new/returning players. With so many events and game modes going on, new/returning players are quickly overwhelmed, even if there's special resources for them. While we live in a fast-paced society, sometimes I just wish to slow down a bit, the games change too quickly and I can't keep up.</p>
<p>Mobile games are more convenient and portable than computer games, but I think I should try out more computer games, there might be less ads and less stressful (I hope), do you have any game recommendations? Preferably not 3D.</p>
