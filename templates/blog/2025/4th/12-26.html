<!--Art Discussion Dream Fixation Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>If you don't know, Twitter recently made a new function where users can edit images in posts using AI with just a click of a button. Of course, artists hated that. While there were many Twitter changes that pushed users to migrate from Twitter, like the time a policy is edited that Grok have the rights to use people's images, I think it is impossible for artists to not leave this time, unless Elon reverses the change.</p>
<p>In the blog of <a href="../3rd/09-12.html">12 Sep 2025</a>, I said I have left Twitter. This is true for a while, until recently, I wanted to look for cool Umamusume art, which Twitter is the most abundant.</p>
<p>When I came back to Twitter after a long time, I realised something: The timeline is far less negative than I remembered. After I liked a ton of Umamusume art, instead of US politics or people venting about being beaten up and the culprit running away scot free, it showed me lots of cute Uma art. Only when I scrolled longer than I should that it would go back to being negative, which then I can just leave Twitter for a couple days.</p>
<p>My current relationship with Twitter is quite positive for the time being, with the Umamusume fandom being active and caring more about horses than random fandom people (man BLLK fandom was boring), I got to see a lot of fun Uma content, like the recently released playable Stay Gold. And man, I love it when people draw the Umas as muscular women &lt;3</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyways fast forward a few weeks, the dumbass AI thing is released. Immediately, people started to discuss where to migrate to. There are two destinations to choose from from what most people suggested, a personal website and BlueSky. There were a lot of pros and cons, and some I have mentioned before:</p>
<h2>Personal Website</h2>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Has the most control</li>
  <li>Can just move host without deleting your files if something goes wrong</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Can't attract people (No algorithm)</li>
  <li>Hard to maintain, especially for people without coding knowledge</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bsky</h2>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Many people already moved there</li>
  <li>Less toxic timeline</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The timeline can be dead for some topics</li>
  <li>The Discover timeline is awful</li>
  <li>It might turn into Twitter 2.0 in the future, cycle restarting</li>
</ul>
<p>As much as I love my site, I understand if people don't want to build a site (I would still encourage them though, nothing wrong with keeping an art archive). But for me, the amount of people caring about my art won't change either one I pick, since I'm an OC artist, might as well post art in somewhere I'm more comfortable in.</p>
<p>As for BlueSky, I've already mentioned what I dislike about it in 10 Nov 2024. However, there are indeed counters for my arguements, and I admit, there are things I could do about it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interact with accounts instead of just liking/retweeting</li>
  <li>Adding lists, especially the For You list</li>
  <li>Following more accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as I remember, I look for art using the algorithm, and I rarely ever comment on art. I feel kinda guilty when Twitter users scold people for not "trying our best to improve" 😔, but yea I do need to comment on artists' posts more, I do love it when people comment on my site as well.</p>
<p>So in the following week, I feel like I should look at BlueSky more, particularly following Umamusume posts. I don't have much faith in Bsky, especially the For You list showed me multiple NSFW art. However, I do crave Umamusume art, and staying in Twitter might not be good in the long run.</p>
<hr>
<p>While social media tends to go bad very fast these days, and it would be great to look for fandom art in indie websites, I find it very difficult to look for fandom art in there, people might not post a lot of stuff, or their sites might in permanent WIP. I'm not saying they are bad for not posting fandom art, I just feel sad I can't find as much fandom art as social media.</p>
<p>I have been thinking of ways to find other people with similar interests as me, like people who like Umamusume and Cookie Run. I have considered drawing more fanart, or making the fixation page include blogs about fixations... But I feel like it would be trying to create for people instead of myself, which I don't like much.</p>
<p>One more thing: I have an idea to draw every single Umamusume, I like drawing cute girls, and it would be a good way to get Uma fans' attention. But I don't have the energy to view every story, I don't want to be seen as a fake fan, and I'm not sure if I have the determination to draw possibly over 100 umas... So if this blog gets 5 comments approving of this idea, I will do this.</p>
