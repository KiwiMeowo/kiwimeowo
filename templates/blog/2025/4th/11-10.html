<p>Before I start, I apparently mistook kayaking as canoeing, since both are called 獨木舟. Oh well, the subtitle is too funny to be changed.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my irrational fears is wet floors. While I don't consider myself a germaphobe, and I don't mind sitting on concrete floors, but if the floor is soaked wet after the rain or it's washed, I would avoid it like it's lava. It always feels like the floor gets 10x dirtier when it's wet, the dirt and gunk is more likely to get stuck to my shoe and skin. When I have to go home, and has to walk on a path full of mushy leaves and seeds(?), I always feel eughasjeilaljfs :(</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is also why I'm very willing to take part in beach cleaning activities. I always feel bothered by the amount of garbage floating on the sea, I don't see the appeal of swimming with plastic packages and bottles. So using this phobia of mine, I make sure the beach will be clean... Unfortunately the beaches can be quite far away, and I don't often have time to go there.</p>
<p>A great thing about beach cleaning is that occasionally you can go on kayaks to visit different islands, you can both have fun and clean the nature! A long time ago, I did go kayaking with a group, and you can choose to have a one-person or two-person kayak. I strongly advise you to not use two-person kayaks, because it is much harder to move the boat when there is two people, and there's also the fact you might get paired with someone you don't get along with, and that happened to me.</p>
<hr>
<p>So recently, I managed to take part in this activity again. As it is autumn, the weather isn't too hot, a (mostly) perfect weather for water based sports. To prepare, I brought two bags of chips, two onigiris, three bottles of water and one sports drink. I don't think I needed that much water, but I was extremely dehydrated last time and I didn't want to take any risks. I also brought a water-proof phone bag so that I can blast music while kayaking, and sunscreen. </p>
<p>To avoid being sunburnt like last time, I wore longer sleeves, it wasn't too hot so I was fine with that. I also bought a pair of shoes for beaches, the past times when I went kayaking, I ended up being stabbed by tiny rocks (what's funny is that I always get injured on Sharp Island lol).</p>
<p>Kayaking isn't too difficult, while I am not a master at it, I figured one of the tricks to save stamina is to use your core muscles and not just arms. Instead of just moving your shoulders and arms, you should also twist your torso to move the paddles. Using this technique, I managed to not exhaust myself too quickly.</p>
<p>It was quite relaxing to kayak alone. You don't have to feel rushed because you have a teammate, or feel ashamed about having not enough stamina and having others to wait for you.Growing up being told I'm the younger, weaker, more inferior one (insults mostly made by my brain) even after trying my best, it does feel better to move at my own pace.</p>
<p>Arriving to the destination, I couldn't notice any visible trash at first. But looking more closely, I could find many trash hiding beneath the sand and bushes. The trash are mostly glass, plastic bottles and food packages, but sometimes you find other stuff, like paint thinner... 	&gt;:0 It won't explode on my way back, right?</p>
<p>With the help of many people, we cleaned off as much trash as possible (some are too big to be brought back). However, the most difficult part during kayaking was the way back to the starting point, as the sun gets unbearably hot and bright during sunset. I remember there was a time I nearly lost all energy having no more water and being exposed to the bright ass sun at 5pm. I luckily brought extra water, though I didn't have sun glasses to block my eyes from the sunlight. It was a fruitful day regardless, not sure if fruitful is a good thing in this case.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was a good call I wore long sleeves, the portions I got sunburnt are minimal, it would've been painful if I got sunburns all over! Also I realised another annoying thing about kayaking is that there aren't much shower spaces around, as they are often full. I recommend showering when you get home.</p>
<p>Kayaking is really fun, as soon as you brought the essentials that is. I don't know if I would take part in kayaking in a short while, so maybe I should try nature cleaning that doesn't involve kayaking...</p>
