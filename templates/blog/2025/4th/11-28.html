<!--Art Discussion Dream Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>As you might see from my updates, I have added a <a href="/dressup/index.html">dress up game</a> to my site. And it's not just a dress up game, it is also an achievement page!</p>
<hr>
<p>So back in my blog of <a href="../1st/01-01.html">Jan 1 2025</a>, I mentioned I enjoyed collecting stickers, including those dress up stickers. To elaborate a bit, I also really love dress up games. One of the earliest flash games I played are dress up games, it was a page with Hello Kitty and a lot of clothings on a flashy background while a Hello Kitty song plays. I was also a fan of Miracle Nikki and Shining Nikki, I enjoyed spending time trying out different clothing combinations and recreate character outfits.</p>
<p>For a very long time, I've had dress up game in my to do list. It is one of the most iconic games of the internet (I think), so it would make sense to make one here as well. However, I hadn't had the motivation to make one because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I have to draw many assets, which is too energy and time consuming</li>
  <li>It doesn't feel that rewarding, I doubt much people will care about this page, nor did I feel I would return to it for a long time</li>
  <li>It just doesn't sound particularly interesting.</li>
</ul>

<center>Finally one task down, wow I should should work on my comics</center>
<p>Many months past, I almost completely forgotten about this idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>While browsing other sites, I've found some people made something very interesting, which is the achievement section. For sites including <a href="https://ne0nbandit.art/" target="_blank">Ne0nBandit</a> and <a href="https://lilithdev.neocities.org/">Lilithdev</a>, they both added some cool achievements to their sites, making exploring their websites more fun.</p>
<p>When I saw that, I was amazed by how clever that idea is. I kinda wanted to make one as well, but I didn't have much ideas on what achievements I should add. Also, I felt like I wanted to find a way to make this idea more cool, it didn't feel too innovative to just follow their steps by the millimeter.</p>
<hr>
<p>So very recently, a very good idea popped into my head: <mark>"Yo what if I combined these two ideas together?"</mark> Boom, everything is coming together.</p>
<p>I actually thought I should make Jaspers the guy to be dressed up, cuz he's half-naked. But that was mostly a joke, so I wanted make Kyrea the dress up character, it just feels fitting! While I haven't gotten much ideas on what new outfits to give her, she already has two outfits: The current one, and the old one.</p>
<p>There are multiple scripts to make elements draggable, but I decided to use the jQuery script, because not only I want the draggable API, I also want to make a droppable. This is used to make the clothing line up perfectly to her body once it's dropped onto her.</p>
<p>Drawing her body took a while, and the fact I'm bad at drawing symmetric poses makes it harder. But drawing outfit is a bit easier, of course since I don't need to worry about poses when drawing clothes.</p>
<p>For now, I only added two achievements, and I secretly added through out different two pages. I couldn't think of much secret pages that can be connected to a clothing style right now, mand I'm exhausted.</p>
<p>I spend the whole day coding and drawing, it's a bit exhausting, and I only added a very few achievements. However, I worked very hard on it, I hope visitors will have fun with it.</p>
