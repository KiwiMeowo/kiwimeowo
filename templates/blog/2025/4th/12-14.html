<h2>Q: Who is the fastest Cookie Run character?</h2>
<p>It's Pomegranate, duh. If you don't get it, let me elaborate.</p>
<hr>
<p>So long long ago, before Cookie Run Ovenbreak had it's nth revamps and nerfs, many cookies had different combi bonuses. Currently, Pomegranate has the bonus of "Bonus pts for Pomegranate Drop Jellies". However, in the past she had the bonus of "Bonus speed 10%".</p>
<p>Adding base speed isn't that interesting, Skater Cookie also increases base speed, and other blast cookies such as Lemon Cookie goes even faster when blast jellies are involved. What's worse about Pome is that her skill is mostly useless, it's only useful when there is a relay. The way her skills works is that she turns the basic jellies into pomegranate seeds, which only worth 1 point (at that time), and when she runs out of energy, she summons a giant pomegranate jelly, which gives the relay energy and a large sum of score. As you can see in breakout, there is no relay, and the only thing her skills does is reduce the score of basic jellies. What's more was that she wasn't a meta in Trophy Race, making her a rarely used cookie... However that changed when the 4th round of the first Grand Champions League happened:</p>

<p>So, bonus speed 10%, speed 10% from the skates, then 19% from the engine, and with the fast map, resulted in a ridiculously fast game. And in the future, Pome was used as the fast round cookie in GCL for a bit...</p>
<p>It's basically a meme in the server I was in and in my friend group, there are funny screenshots saved:</p>

<p>I suddenly remembered this joke recently since I took a screenshot of my phone menu and a friend took notice of my album which featured Sonic Pome, it brought back some nice memories.</p>
