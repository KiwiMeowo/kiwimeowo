<!--Art Discussion Dream Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>Social media promotes negative stuff more, this isn't news. Because users tend to have bigger reactions towards negative and angry stuff, social media use this aspect of people to get them look at posts more. But what I am frustrated is that even the accounts on social media are promoting negative comments as well.</p>
<p>On Instagram, most of the reels are quite nice, mostly animals or cat memes. And sometimes, there will be other stuff like art reels or people making products. Over the months, I've noticed a pattern, that some people often put the hateful comments in their reels and debating/revoking their opinion.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this type of reels can be helpful. I might have the same type of questions the comments have (But in a calmer tone), and the reel will resolve some confusion I had. However, this type of reels is EVERYWHERE. The reels will share comments like "YOU ARE ABUSING YOUR CAT BY NEUTERING IT KYS !!!1111!1!!" then the poster will say "lol your wrong", then the comment section will be like "omg this comment is so stupid im sorry abt that". And this pattern will repeat over, and over, and over....</p>
<p>At this point, I feel like the accounts are using the hate comments to promote their account. I know Instagram comments can be awful, like I mentioned before, but putting these comments in the spotlight will only give the haters the attention they want, it just feeds into the hate. These reels, intentionally or not, are making the social media more negative.</p>
<p>It is really sad how there is no social media where I can safely look at dumb cat memes. I should focus more on doing my hobbies, even though I still haven't figured how to fid my creative juice.</p>
