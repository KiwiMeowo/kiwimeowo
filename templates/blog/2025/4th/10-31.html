<p>Lately, I felt quite bothered the lack of interesting dreams. There's one about <a href="10-05.html">party games</a>, but it didn't feel as cool after I woke up. Today is Halloween, and coincidentally, the dream I had today is quite scary.</p>
<p>The dream is divded into three parts, and each part isn't really related to one another.</p>
<h2>Part 1: Cookies</h2>
<p>The first part was just me looking for ingredients for cookies, this might be due to my urge to make cake pops. There wasn't anything special aside me walking around in a store.</p>
<h2>Part 2: Assassination attempts</h2>
<p>This part, I played a role of somm random man, and apparently I was wanted by some military group or mafia. The leader sent a lot of soldiers to kill me, I was in a hallway with a door at the end, and behind the door is another hallway, and each hallway has a soldier that wants to kill me. However, despite how powerful they seem, I killed them or they died from other circumstances, sometimes they died before I even got there, lol. </p>
<p>However, on a certain room, which might have belonged to the strongest soldier (who diedbefore I got there), I got killed by a trap, biting onto my neck like a beast eating its prey. Then like the plot armour of a protagonist, I somehow possessed the body of the soldier. And apparently the boss who wanted me dead liked that soldier very much, so I had to nervously pretend to be the soldier, and try to not get her suspicious.</p>
<h2>Part 3: Zombie apocalypse</h2>
<p>The third part is a zombie apocalypse, unlike my other dreams featuring an apocalypse, it has a depressing tone more than a exciting, thrilling one. The vast majority of the human population were infected, basically everyone I met, including my family, my friends, my schoolmates, became a zombie. I was truly alone there, which makes the dream terrifying. Hiding is impossible as well, as zombies always find a way to detect your presence, and they can work together to break open barriers.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn't exactly alone, I had a cockatiel which will notify me when a zombie gets too close. Unfortunately, so many people has gotten infected, there was always at least one zombie ten meters near you. So to survive there, the cockatiel chirps, I fly away before the zombie gets me, lands on a spot that the zombie won't get to you (for now), repeat.</p>
<p>The worst parts of the two parts is the amount of gore present. Censoring in case you are put off by the description of blood and gore: <span class="spoiler">Everywhere I went, there were blood and multilated body parts. Sometimes I would see other people with guns shooting at bodies already long dead, the flesh blasting into pieces while fingers flew away. Even in the state of dream, I felt kinda sick!</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Honestly, even a scary dream is still an entertaining one, as soon as it doesn't show my traumatic memories. And the fact it's halloween makes the dream more on theme, right?</p>
<p>P.S. What are other good alternatives to foollovers.com? Majority of the images from wayback machine (the website blocked my region for some reason) aren't available.</p>
