<!--Art Discussion Dream Fixation Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>I haven't tried any horror media for a while, but recently I stumbled upon this pilot called <a href="https://youtu.be/NFhaUF5gElQ?si=wocWY1rM0mqWVtXx" target="_blank">Poppin-Play Kitchen</a>. It's created by Zemyata, an animator which I've been following.</p>
<p>The animation about three hosts (P-chan, C-chan and U-chan) hosting a cooking show, which the food and tools are toys, and a giant human hand supplies them the ingredients. They HAVE to satisfy the audience, or else they might end up becoming Toast!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Spoilers below</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed the pilot, it's really short but there's a charm that I love. For one, I enjoyed shows that basically puts the lifes of characters on the line. Despite how hard the hosts tried, the best they could get is adequate. Honestly I think the audience is too harsh, the fruity "egg toast" U-chan makes is really cute!</p>
<p>I also love how the characters are portrayed. P-chan seems to be somewhat harsh towards U-chan, likely because U-chan is new and still nervous about being made into a toy, and showing nervousness is a bad idea. P-chan and C-chan has been in the show longer, so they can compose themselves better, P-chan even stays her usual attitude when given a pan made of a previous member! And I love how after U-chan finishes making her toast perfectly, C-chan gives double thumbs up, a small gesture that really shows C-chan's cheerful personality. And for U-chan, being a new host(age) of the cooking show, she tries harder to seek for help, but considering how the other two hosts didn't, maybe seeking help is pointless after all.</p>
<p>(Also, after rewatching and seeing they laughing at the beginning, I can imagine P-chan be like "The show is starting, quickly pretend we had a funny conversation and laugh!", it's kinda funny NGL)</p>
<p>An important detail is that U-chan calls for help to the audience multiple times through out the show. One obvious moment is at the end when she says "If there's anything you can't do yourself, just ask for help", seemingly putting emphasis on helping. The second one (which I didn't notice until someone pointed it out) is before the cooking starts, when U-chan is saying "If there's anything you can't do yourself, remember to ask an adult for help", she tucks her thumb inside her palms, which is a hand gesture for help. She also puts a one hand in thumbs up gesture onto her other palm, which is another sign for help.</p>
<p>And another detail is that aside from not making the food, the satisfaction level also drops whenever the hosts hints at anything bad is happening to them. When U-chan attempts to ask for help, the satisfaction level drops or the show ends. And for C-chan, the reason she got turned into a carton of milk isn't because they don't like the egg toast, but because she said "I thought I was gonna get turned into silverware".</p>
<h2>I love toy food</h2>
<p>What I also REALLY love is how they use toy food in the cooking show. There is such a satisfying thing about playing with cooking toys, I used to play with them a lot as a kid, I even remember "cooking" a toy steak for my mom. But of course, since they are just toys, there isn't much you can do with them aside from cutting (if the toy is made to be cut in half) and "cooking" (putting them on the plastic pan and no fire doesn't do anything obviously).</p>
<p>This is also why I love this animation, it cooks toy food the way my child brain wants to happen. Even if the food is static and plastic, the appearance of the food changes depending on how you cook it. Put bread into a non-electric toy toaster, boom, it has a charred surface now! Want to apply whipped cream and fruit onto the toast? Bam, now it has a thick layer of whipped cream and fruit perfectly fitted onto the slice of toast! Need to cut a hole on the toast? Bang, the hard plastic bread has a hole cut without a sweat! It really scratches the itch in my brain I forgot I have.</p>

<p>As it's a pilot, there's a chance more episodes will be released, which I hope there will be.</p>
