<h2 style="color: red;">Warning for dissociation (I think)</h2>
<p>It's late at night because I drank coffee in the afternoon, and now my brain is wandering.</p>
<p>If you have read my earlier blogs in 29 Nov 2023 and 10 Mar 2024, you know have some imaginary friends in my head to cope with loneliness. They have been in my head since a long time ago, the oldest one appeared when I was in secondary school. One is a cynical critic who lost hope in my future, one is a positive mentor who pushes me to perform my best (which might be just me masking lmao), one who is a pissed off edgy child who wants to kill everything, and one is a hopeless romantic who loves the idea of dating but feels disgusted about dating most real people (I didn't introduce this one before). These voices get very noisy sometimes, but they are how I felt less lonely.</p>
<p>I sometimes try to search this phenomenon online, but the results came mixed. Dissociation? DID? Just simple brain stuff that kids do? I doubt it's a big concern, so I don't think I need to figure it all out.</p>
<p>But sometime last year, probably mid way through 2025, I started to hear them less. I didn't pay much thought, I assumed that my brain got too busy with real life stuff that I couldn't talk to them as much. But as time went on, the absence of these voices started to bother me, why am I the only one talking in my head?</p>
<p>To describe how I talk to my imaginary friends, it was as simple as lifting a finger. My brain starts imagining them talking when I think about a cool topic, like seeing a cool video, drawing, thinking about anxiety etc. I don't <i>actually</i> hear them, but the imagination was quite vivid. But now, it feels like talking to a wall, they weren't there at all. Even if I try to imagine a voice, it just feels like I'm grabbing a doll and making it move with my hands,  doing that doesn't make the doll alive.</p>
<p>It's hard to figure out why, Google isn't giving me much useful answers. But one possible answer is that I have been less alone, which reduces my need for these voices. I've met new friends during internship, I've been hanging out with my closest friend (and even started dating him!), it was surprisingly a great year. But if it were the case, I still wished these voices to come back.</p>
<p>While these friends don't exist in real life, and they might hurt me sometimes, their presence did make my life more entertaining. They were the ones that helped me through my hardest times, and sometimes give me cool ideas and thoughts. Now my head feels quiet, it's peaceful, but I feel lonely in another way.</p>
<p>Talking about this topic makes me seem like a strange person, I'm worried people who see this blog would think I'm insane. I just pray this is actually a common experience, and that I will find an explaination for this. Anyways, I hope my voices will come back soon.</p>
<p>P.S. This blog is written on 15 Jan, but I wanted to write another blog on the same day later lmao.</p>
