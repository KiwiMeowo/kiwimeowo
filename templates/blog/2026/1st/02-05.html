<!--Art Discussion Dream Fixation Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>Last night, I had a dream where I was in an elevator with my cousin, not sure why, how and where. So as we were standing in the elevator, a group of people in scary costumes went inside. And after the elevator moved to a lower floor, the group of people left, except for three scary-looking kids, they look like <a href="https://youtu.be/ooHiFoWz50U?si=0sOmJ_HaVQzZHSj9" target="_blank">this ghost kid that speaks random Japanese words in that horror movie</a>.</p>
<p>My cousin concernedly whispered to my ear, "Ghost children!" Warning me about the danger we were in. I glanced at the kids, they giggled childishly, I smiled at them politely, not wanting to anger the ghosts (or offend them in case they aren't actually ghosts).</p>
<p>Suddenly, they made us play a game. There was a slot machine-like wheel in front of us, we have to move the wheels so that each row has the same symbols. If we lose, we will never go back to the land of living, and be tortured by the kids forever. There was like 6 columns, and a lot of rows, it was more difficult than it seemed. Apparently, I was so stressed that time that I dissociated the whole game. However, my cousin managed to complete that game, the kids vanished, and the elevator went back to normal.</p>
<p>After that, I went back home reimagining that scene in my head: What if I also played it? It was so vivid that I felt like I was back in that moment. So I tried to turn the wheels and match the rows, some rows got matched, but the others didn't. I tried to spin the wheels more, but I just couldn't get all the rows to match. Then time was up, and we got sent to limbo. Well I guess it's a good thing I didn't play that!</p>
