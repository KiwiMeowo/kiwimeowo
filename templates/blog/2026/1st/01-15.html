<!--Art Discussion Dream Fixation Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>With Millennial Tree breaking Dark Enchantress' barrier, it's time for the Ancients to break through, the war between the darkness and cookies starts now. And surprisingly, the story is quite entertaining.</p>
<hr>
<h2>New Story</h2>
<p>Some of the Cookies investigated the laboratorium, the place that was used to make the ultimate cookie. Wizard and Espresso studied a strange magic circle and unusual letters. And Wizard suddenly realised a horrible implication, while Cookie-baking results won't last long without a Soul Jam or Magic Candy, Dark Enchantress had a large supply of energy: Dragontongue. And that's how the three dough cookies came to be, made to stop the cookies and the dragons from defeating Dark Enchantress.</p>
<p>At first, I didn't care much about these cookies, maybe just Venom Dough Cookie, as their design slays so hard. Mold Dough Cookie looks ugly with his disproportionately large chest, and Pom-Pom Dough Cookie looks just like a generic bubbly, cute girl... But when she started talking, boy did my mind change. The moment Pom-Pom Dough met the Cookie Soldiers, she started blaming them for starting a war with Dark Enchantress, which lead to them being created in such painful bodies. Despite their powers, their bodies are constantly falling apart, the thing that keeps them alive is the Life Energy constantly healing them. They are like a living corpse, being alive with this body causes them so much pain. And during the battle, Pom-Pom keeps crying and complaining about her unbearable headache... Man I was not expecting so much angst in a character that's just debuted, I feel so bad for her that I'm actually interested in these characters now.</p>
<p>While it seems hopeless that these three powerful cookies are created, the heroes' side aren't helpless. While Pomegranate Cookie is observing the battlefield, she realised the Life Energy is being drain away. And as it turns out, Dark Choco came to help the struggling kingdoms, removing as much Pomegranate Seeds as possible to stop the rampaging beasts. I felt somewhat emotional when I saw the cookies trying to stay alive in the war, especially the part Clover Cookie was playing his ukelele to comfort Custard III (I don't even like Custard III due to that rhythm minigame btw). War is scary man.</p>
<p>Pome is often times quite collected, but this time she got so pissed, she shattered her mirror. Like god damn, go crash out girl!!! I hope some Pome artist would draw a pissed off Pome smashing a mirror with her fists, oh I love Pome.</p>
<p>In desperation, Pome brought out her enhanced Pomegranate Seeds for her soldiers (except for Pom-Pom Dough and Venom Dough), anyone who uses it will be forever bound to darkness and their bodies might crumble under its powers. Pom-Pom Dough was reluctant at first, she wouldn't want to cause pain upon her allies, but their mission is to defeat the heroes, at all costs. When Pom-Pom Dough brought the gems to Mold Dough Cookie, he simply asked to hand over the gems, without any complaints, completely determined to continue his mission. When Pom-Pom Dough started crying for him, I actually felt so heartbroken :(</p>
<p>And after the Ancients battled Mold Dough Cookie, of course the blue ass jester interrupted the battle. Seriously Devsis stop giving him this much screentime. The gem broke after Shadow Milk appeared, maybe Mold Dough is saved from eternal damnation idk.</p>
<hr>
<p>Aside from the main story, we also got to know more about the Beasts past. What I found the most funny is that Shadow milk was corrupted because he was so sick of people asking him stupid questions. Many fans now call him FountGPT, because many dumb people also ask AI about dumb questions, and AI often times make shit up as answers. Yea FountGPT will be his new name now.</p>

<p>I wrote far less then I expected huh. Anyways, <a href="https://x.com/MGM_CRK/status/2011387442260254758?s=20" target="_blank">the Dough Cookies deserve rest</a>.</p>
