<!--Art Discussion Dream Fixation Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>I sometimes go to cool places like theme parks and museums, I don't mention them a lot in my blogs just in case there's insanely intellegent doxxers/stalkers who can learn my location by the slightest info I mention. However, I really wanted to talk about it, just because there's one photo that I believe should be left a mark in my blogs.</p>

<h2>Carnival rides</h2>
<p>So recently, I learnt about the AIA carnival, and that entry is free for students. I decided to tell my boyfriend about it, and we went there. I was quite worried about the prices, while entry is free, we still need to purchase tokens to play the games there. It is HKD$10 per token, and we don't have much information on how much tokens for each ride, so I felt like it would cost a lot. Regardless, I felt like it would be a good time playing there.</p>
<p>We went around the carnival, looking for games and rides that seems fun. There are rides that are obviously too scary for us, like the pendulum ride, pirate ship and pendulum ride but two sided. After one walk, we decided on one that isn't too scary, but still fun.</p>
<h3>Spiral slide (3 tokens)</h3>
<p>We went inside of the tower and climbed the stairs, at the top we would place down the carpet thing and slide down. While slides might not be scary to many, the speed that accumulates when sliding made me anxious, and I had to slow down using my arms. It was quite fun.</p>
<h3>Big rollercoaster (7 tokens)</h3>
<p>There are like different sizes of rollercoasters, but we went to the bigger one. From the looks of it, we believed that it was exciting, but not too far out from our comfort zone. It was a ride with a lot of turns, it was very shaky too. The drops were a little scary, but it wasn't the scariest ride I have ridden, the bumpyness increased the fear factor though.</p>
<h3>Big inflatable slide (5 tokens I think?)</h3>
<p>There was a giant inflatable castle with tall slides, which quickly intrigued me. Unlike the other rides, you can play the slide as much as you like within 5 minutes. Being a slide lover (maybe), I was quite excited. We went up the castle by stairs, and slid down, and repeat. It was really fun, the pink slide was particularly slippery. However, after a few slides, we started to feel exhausted from all the stairs. By the end of our session, our legs couldn't walk properly anymore, and we had to sit on the floor for like 5 minutes.</p>
<h3>Bumper car (7 tokens I think?)</h3>
<p>I played bumper car with my sister somewhere else before, I find it very fun to bump into my sister's car in full speed. When I saw the ride, I looked around the queue (as it's a bit more fun playing with more people), when a group of people came, we immediately joined them.</p>
<p>The speed wasn't as fast as the one I rode before, my entire body didn't tremble when I bump into my boyfriend's car. However, I still find it funny to exclusively target his car while trying to dodge other people. Also, apparently there's a sign saying "No head-to-head bumping", I thought it was one of the main things to do in bumper car, but I stopped myself from doing that there, or at least I tried.</p>
<h3>Medium swing ride (6 tokens)</h3>
<p>One of my favorite rides is swing ride, instead of intense speed, you get wind brushing against you and a beautiful view in front of your eyes. Also, the fact I have my boyfriend with me means I get to sit on the ride with him, no more being annoyed by lovey-dovey couples sitting at my front and back (cuz I'm one of them now)! There's also a even taller swing ride, but I find it too pricey (12 tokens).</p>
<p>Despite my impression for swing rides, this particular ride spins very fast, so fast it felt like the slowest rollercoaster I've been (which was still quite speedy). While I love feeling the speed, it also made me quite dizzy, and I couldn't see the view very well.</p>

<h2>Game stalls</h2>
<p>There are also game stalls that give you prizes if you win, all of them cost 2 tokens for each round, the amount of attempts depends on the game but it's usually 4 attempts.</p>
<h3>Duck fishing</h3>
<p>It's a game where you fish 4 ducks from a pool of water, and at the end you get points depending on the number labels under the ducks. While the gimmick is fishing, it's all just luck-based. I got 2 points, while my boyfriend got 4, and you need at least 5 points in a round to get a prize, <emote class="gumer"></emote>. It made me sad cuz there was Minecraft-like plushies, except they look ugly and one of them is a chicken with a pig model, I want them :(</p>
<h3>Rebound board</h3>
<p>It's a game where you throw a ball onto a board on top of a box, the goal is to make the ball touch the board and drop into the box. The difficulty is that the ball is very bouncy, you either didn't put enough energy to make it touch the board, or the ball bounces away from the box. With added bonus, there's a stick at the bottom of the board and you can't make it drop. So if your ball doesn't bounce off from the board and simply rolls down, it will make the stick fall and your result doesn't count. Anyways we didn't win anything after using all 4 attempts.</p>
<h3>Dart throwing (Honeycomb shape)</h3>
<p>You get 4 darts, and you have to throw them into the boxes in the honeycomb-shaped board, and you get points depending the number you land on. I forgot how much score we got, but we were nowhere from getting any prizes.</p>
<h3>Dart throwing (Character cards)</h3>
<p>Similar to above, except you throw the darts onto the pictures/cards on a wall. There are two things that make it far easier, you only need one successful throw to earn a price instead of a score based system, and the area for the target is quite dense. I actually won a small plushie from this!</p>

<h3>Ring toss game</h3>
<p>You actually get more attempts for this game, it was like 10 rings for 2 tokens, and 6 tokens for a bucket I think. It is extremely difficult, I see people throwing rings every second but none of them win a prize after a long time. But one good thing about this game is that once you win, you get a giant prize (giant plushie). Of course I didn't except myself to win, but I do want to at least have fun with it. So I got 5 rings (I split them with my boyfriend), hold them with one hand, then thr-</p>
<p>"One ring every throw please" The worker told us before we started our game, you can imagine my disappointment that I can't just yeet all of them together. Maybe that method is actually cracked at winning at game, so they banned that method.</p>
<h3>Ball toss cup game</h3>
<p>There is a table placed entirely with cups, most are white, some are colored. You have 4 attempts to throw your ball and get it to land on a colored cup, and you get a prize depending on what color you landed. But seriously, it's too difficult to even get it to land on a cup! The ball was stupidly bouncy, and even if I try to do a backspin throw, it still bounces off.</p>
<h3>Ball toss bottle game</h3>
<p>It's extremely simple, there's a bottle, you have 4 balls, you win when you get one to land inside. However, as a person with horrible arm control, I didn't get it inside.</p>

<h2>Bonus: AIA Ferris Wheel</h2>
<p>As it is right next to the carnival, we decided to give it a visit. The ferris wheel is a landmark I often see when inside of buses, but I never went inside of it. Surprisingly, it wasn't as expensive as I thought, it is only HKD$20 for adults. You have to pay like HKD$150+ for a private cabins, but it isn't very necessary I think. There was a lot of construction sites around, but overall the view was quite nice.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful day, not only the rides were fun, I got to spend the day with someone I dearly love. Anyways, my thighs hurted after walking the stairs on the slide, I'm old.</p>
