<!--Art Discussion Dream Fixation Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>So back in <a href="../../2025/3rd/09-01.html">1 Sep 2025</a>, I mentioned so much I am afraid of malfunctioning machines, and one of which is the water heater at my home. It's eerie LED glow, showing just a ten digit number, like a machine planning your next demise... Anyways why do I mention this? It's malfunctioning.</p>
<hr>
<p>The water heater is very old, it has been in our bathroom as long as I remember, so it makes sense it will need fixing and maintainence very soon. So very recently, when I was in the middle of showering, I turned my back on the heater, then it <s>stabbed me at the back</s> suddenly started pouring cold water. The weather being cold and all makes the cold extremely unbearable, so I turned back in fear, only to see the LED screen is blinking a number: 14. Why did you give me 14 Celsius water????</p>
<p>So I went out of the bathroom, telling my sister about it. She said she also encountered this, but it will go away after turning it off and on several times. After doing the same, it worked again, but there are no guarantees that it won't malfunction again. I quickly finished showering and left the bathroom as soon as possible, lately I feel extremely afraid that the heater will break again.</p>
<p>I just looked up online for the water heater 14 error code, and <a href="https://www.towngasappliance.com/media/download/RS131TM%20RS131RM%20RS161TM%20RS161RM%20User%20Instructions%20202209.pdf" target="_blank">found a document</a>, it might not be the same model but I assume it's similar enough. It says the error code means 殘火保護裝置啟動或防止過熱保
護裝置啟動 or Remaining flame safety device activated or heat exchanger overheat protection device activated, so I need to contact customer service it seems. We should get it fixed quickly, staying in the cold for too long isn't very good (and I'm too terrifies of the water heater).</p>
