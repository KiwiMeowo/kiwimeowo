<!--Art Discussion Dream Fixation Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>So in my many years of learning coding and Javascript, I have utilised JS a lot in my website, ranging from blog tag filtering, fetch APIs for the index page, image viewers, and more. While using them too much might slow down the site, there are just so many stuff I want to do, I couldn't stop adding new JS code!</p>
<p>But it turns out, my naive eyes have been neglecting a powerful tool, which is CSS.</p>
<hr>
<p>I regularly browse the <a href="https://forum.melonland.net/" target="_blank">Melonland Forum</a>, I wouldn't say I frequently post there, but I enjoy seeing other indie web doing their own thing, or even comment on posts I feel related to!</p>
<p>Recently, I came across this post called <a href="https://forum.melonland.net/index.php?topic=4975.msg49069#msg49069" target="_blank">"What features do you add to make your website more interactive?"</a>, as a webmaster who wants to add more cool gimmicks, I clicked to look for any cool ideas. And one reply caught my eye in particular: which is <a href="https://forum.melonland.net/index.php?topic=4975.msg47926#msg47926">Dan Q's dressup menu</a>. He uses svg format for the character images so that the colors can be changed using CSS variables, and the coolest of all? It uses no Javascript whatsoever!</p>
<p>My jaw dropped when I heard about this. The trick to this is using the :has() psuedo-selector, which I thought didn't exist. This selector selects elements which contain a certain element/selector, which operators like "+", ">", "," can't do. I'm bad at explaining stuff so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/:has">here's a guide</a>. Early on in my HTML coding journey, I did wish to look for this type of selector so that a rule can activate when an element contains something, but my searches yielded no results, so I assumed it did not exist. Well I was very wrong!</p>
<p>Back to the No-JS thing, the way it works is by using input buttons and the :checked psuedo-selector. When a button is checked, a CSS rule can be set like this:</p>
<pre>
  body:has(.radio:checked){--variable:white;}
  body:has(.radio2:checked){--variable:yellow;}
  body:has(.radio3:checked){--variable:blue;}
</pre>
<p>By using this, the variable changes depending on the button checked, no JS involved! Having this new knowledge, I went to improve some of my code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The theme toggler in my index page mostly relies on CSS now</li>
  <li>The flip cards in the OC section is 100% CSS</li>
  <li>(To be done) Make the song section windows 100% CSS</li>
</ul>
<p>I also had the idea to make the art gallery pages toggleable using CSS only, but I couldn't find a way to make it that it won't cause me 5 layers of pain everytime I add a new page. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how much it changes aside from flexing my new knowledge of CSS, but it might be better, somehow?</p>
