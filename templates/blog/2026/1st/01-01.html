<!--Art Discussion Dream Fixation Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>This is my third time I've celebrated new years with my site, I even timed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbuNxmAXdNk" target="_blank">Human by Flavor Foley</a> to new years with my clock on the index page! Well I was one second off, but eh close enough.</p>
<p>Every time the year number increments by one, I have a new task that is ready a new page for 2026 for blog and art sections. Well, I technically add a new page for blogs every quarter, but the process for a new year update is slightly longer.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Blog</h2>
<p>Before I used 11ty, the blogs are in the form of collapsibles instead of indivual pages. The blogs of the current quarter are written on the index page, when a new quarter comes, I just move them to a new page.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add a new page (eg 2024a.html, 2024b.html)</li>
  <li>Update the sidebar and navbar blog selector to include the new quarter under the current year collapsible</li>
</ol>
<p>But after I got 11ty, things got a bit more automatic. I don't have to add a new page for each quarter manually. However, I have other things to update now.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Modify the index templates to show blogs in the current quarter by default</li>
  <li>Modify my template to use the current quarter tag</li>
  <li>Add the new page to the blog map page</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Art</h2>
<p>For my art page, they don't need to be updated quarterly as they only have one page per year. So the updating routine is just:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a new page for the year</li>
  <li>Add a link to the new page in the art index page</li>
  <li>Update the index page to show the newest art in the current year</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>For both instances, one thing I would <u>really</u> want to do is to add a new blog and art. It would feel somewhat empty if I don't add anything to the new pages, it would result in an awkward empyt page. So today, I've added a new art, and this new blog to celebrate new years... So yes this is blog is technically a filler :P</p>
