<!--Art Discussion Dream Fixation Game Life OC Review Vent-->
<p>The newest chapter of the Dark Enchantress War just fully released (The chapter was out days ago, but the last few stages are released yesterday).</p>
<p>Following last time, Shadow Milk suddenly appears and torments the soldiers with hallucinations. Many saw horrifying visions, such as them bleeding out, everything smiling uncontrollably, everyone was in fear. Pure Vanilla arrives to the scene in an airship, telling Shadow Milk to stop. And what happened next, is probably my top favorite scene of the Dark Enchantress War:</p>

<p>It's such an funny way to attack a villain, like in a world of magic, instead of some fancy spells, you just use an ordinary vehicle, and it somehow works. But of course, Beasts don't die from just a simple attack, but it gives time for the other Ancients to run away to find Dark Enchantress.</p>
<p>In the chapter, the pattern is that the Ancient will meet their respective Beast (except White Lily, who isn't there for some reason), then a Elemental will come to help, defeating the Beast. While I won't explain all of them, the fight of Burning Spice and Eternal Sugar caught my attention.</p>
<p>When Burning Spice came to Hollyberry and Golden Cheese, he started attacking using weird giant feet magic (for context, the Beasts are using attacks that has human body parts), injuring many soldiers and certainly obstructing the Ancients. Luckily, Moonlight Cookie came to help, putting Burning Spice and his soldiers to sleep. When he woke up, he found himself fighting Golden Cheese, except he felt something was off, as if he's fighting over and over again in a cycle. His whole backstory is about him wanting to escape the endless cycle of life and delve into the path of destruction,but in this scene shows that even in destruction he can not run away the constant repetition.</p>
<p>As Hollyberry moves forward, boulders suddenly came falling towards her team. She suddenly felt a figure shielding her from the boulders, when she tried to thank the figure, she realised it's Eternal Sugar, shielding her like how Hollyberry shielded Eternal Sugar back then. She tried to drag her back into the garden, but Hollyberry insisted to leave, as there's a war going on. Hollyberry doesn't hate Eternal Sugar, she said Eternal Sugar was who made her able to protect her loved ones with all her heart, and wishes Eternal Sugar to change. Sadly, Eternal Sugar's desperation is stronger, she would rather trap Hollyberry than to change herself, too much passion is painful.</p>
<p>Fire Spirit then comes to the rescue, giving Hollyberry the power of fire. Despite Eternal Sugar having wings to fly, she refuses to let go of Hollyberry, letting herself on fire. Her entire body is charred, but she held onto Hollyberry until she physically can't. Eternal Sugar is a Beast of Sloth, wanting everyone to abandon their passion to never worry about anything again. Despite that, she chose to cling onto Hollyberry even if this is hurting her, isn't this the opposite of slothful? It's very poetic that even Eternal Sugar, perhaps not consciously, chooses a path of passion.</p>
<p>When Gingerbrave and his team went to look for Dark Enchantress' location, the Dough trio went to stop them. Pom-pom, being in pain, complains that if Gingerbrave is gone, Dark Enchantress plans will fall apart, and the Dough trio will not have to go through pain anymore. After saying that, Dark Enchantress punishes her using her magic, she cried in pain asking for forgiveness. While I do love Cookies of Darkness, Dark Enchantress really pissed me off that scene. Seeing what Dark Enchantress did, Venom Dough broke his last straw, furious about them and their siblings being exploited all the time. They broke up their chains, and attempted to kill Gingerbrave. But the Silver Knight came, so the Dough Trio have to run away, having betrayed Dark Enchantress.</p>
<p>When the Ancients approach Dark Enchantress' castle, Silent Salt arrived, stopping them from going further. When they broke free of Silent Salt's silent curse, the other Beasts also arrived. When Shadow Milk was about to mess with the Cookies again, Dark Enchantress came and revealed the secret of Silent Salt: That it's not the witches who sealed them away, but is Silent Salt and Elder Fairie's doing. Shadow Milk, who has complex hatred of witches, has a shocking realisation that the witches never even punished him, and the Salt of Solidarity betrayed the Beasts. When Shadow Milk fell into rage, Silent Salt stabbed him, and put the Beasts into the silent curse.</p>
<p>Dark Enchantress, knowing this exact scene will happen, used this opportunity to siphon both the Ancients and the Beasts' power to summon a spell: A oven to turn herself an entity that's neither a cookie nor a human, something far more powerful. When she went into the oven, she reflected the time when she fell into the dough as White Lily Cookie. The witches were amused that a cookie fell into the dough, so they decided to add more cookies to the mix. White Lily felt the screams, pain and suffering of the other crumbled cookies, their consciousness merging into one being.</p>
<p>Dark Enchantress didn't cause this war to enact suffering into cookies, she instead wishes <mark>freedom</mark> for cookiekind, to be free from their fragile bodies and their fate to be eaten by humans. One of the cutscene during her flashback is a bright sun shining through bushes of thorns and vines, even if her powers are full of suffering, she genuinely believes what she's doing will bring a greater good.</p>
<p>When her spell is completed, she gained a new body. She is not a cookie anymore, she's simply referred as "Dark Enchantress". A humanoid body, full set of fingers, she laughs in joy while others watched in horror... Bro that's a lot of body horror.</p>
<hr>
<p>I actually didn't have high expectations as I just assumed Shadow Milk will take up 90% of screen time, well he still took up a significant amount of screen time, but much of the story is done shockingly well. I wonder what Dark Enchantress will do, and what will happen to the rest of the CoD, I hope Pome will be fine...</p>
